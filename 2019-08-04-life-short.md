I don’t have the time to write a long book.

I figured I can die tomorrow or any day and I haven’t put together my life wisdom in any meaningful way.

So here I am. Typing this on my iPhone.

Life is short.

When I hit 30, the number of funerals I attended increased dramatically.

Consider the possibility of your death.

And consider the possibility of a loved one's death.

Think on this, then give thanks for your and loved one's life.
