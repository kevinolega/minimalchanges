I saw the Joker movie.

I liked it.

At the same time, it terrifies me.

I expected to like it, but it disturbs me how much I could relate to the story. 

At the time that I saw the film, I heard about different controversies.

The summary of the Joker is about how one bad day can turn your life upside down.

## Here's my take:

The Joker is not a story about a white man doing violent things.

The Joker is a warning.

The Joker is a story about what happens to you, if you decide to keep quiet about your true feelings.

The Joker is a story about what happens to you if you don't speak your truth and don't stand up for yourself.

The Joker is a story about what happens to you if you are not specific about what you want and you don't carry out your intentions.

The Joker is a story about what happens if you don't live your life in the real world and live it all in your heart and in you mind.

Every time you don't say what you want to say, the seed of the Joker is planted in your heart.

Every time you let other people bully you or take advantage of you, the seed of the Joker is planted in your heart.

Every time you withhold the truth in order to avoid conflict, the seed of the Joker is planted in your heart.

That desire to get revenge is a side effect of the build up of resentment that you allowed to accumulate.

This becomes toxic.

This poisons you.

And eventually this will influence your interaction with other people.

That's just my thing.

Practice more honesty.

Communicate what you want to yourself and get to work.

Don't allow other people to abuse you and take advantage of you.

Learn to fight back and push back when you are being intimidated.

Early conflict no matter how bad it gets is a million times better than slowly accumulating resentment and returning to the people who wronged you with a gun in hand, ready to shoot people.

The Joker is a warning.

Don't plant that seed in your heart.

## NOTE:

You might find this offensive so I put this all the way up to the end.

I just wanted to get this out of the way.

I'm a big fan of Joaquin Phoenix.

I am moved by his portrayal of Commodus in the Gladiator film for playing the asshole emperor.

I almost cried in his performance in Ladder 41.

A vegan told me a few months back that Joaquin Phoenix is a vegan now and has been for years.

And when I saw the Joker film and they showed his body, it's like a scene from Sv3rige's Vegans are the Epitome of Malnourishment video series.

That is so fucked up.
