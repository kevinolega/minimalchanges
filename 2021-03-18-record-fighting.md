You already record lifting videos of yourself.

You also record your workouts.

Record yourself practicing martial arts.

You've recorded some of your bag work at the gym.

Record your shadow boxing.

You only see 20% of what's actually happening.

Using a recorder gives you an outside perspective that you usually only get from a coach or instructor.
