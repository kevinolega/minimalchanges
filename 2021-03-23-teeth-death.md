I lost a tooth today.

I feel that God is reminding me that I'm going to die.

My body's falling apart and there is nothing that I can do about it.

We're all going to get sick.

Learn to appreciate what we have.

We are all going to die.

The nature of life is musical.

The song is eventually going to end.

All we get to decide is what to do while the song is playing.
