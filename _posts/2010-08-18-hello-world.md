Please be patient. This site like the author is still under construction.

Hi, I just started the blog and it's called minimal changes.  

My blog is about changing your life using, drumroll, minimal changes. 

As most of us know or have tried progress in leaps and bounds had been the norm and the thing is although speed is attractive it is also pretty hard to maintain and as a result we get frustrated with our growth even if we are actually growing. 

I invite you to apply the lessons you can learn from this blog to help improve your situation. 

Please note that most of the lessons here are results of trial and mostly error so the advice might not be perfect but hopefully you can make things work  soon enough. 

Just be patient with yourself and know that minimal changes over time can eventually get you where you want to go. 

[Visit my "now page" to see what I'm up to at the moment][1].

**Updated Monday, September 10, 2018 and a message from Kevin of the present day**.

Minimal changes has then evolved into an approach that I follow throughout my life after I started this blog.

Prior to these two words receiving my attention, I was addicted to speed.

As a result I have been running into obstacles, failing miserably and  manipulated by people who promise shortcuts.

There are no shortcuts. 

There is no business or secret that "gets you to your dreams faster."

Life goals are built with your life's work.

Each valuable pursuit whether it's wealth, health and fitness, family and relationships, personal goals or whatever it is, will take an incredible amount of time to achieve.

A lot of these will require you to go through approximately eighteen thousand levels, people usually refer to as days. 

Many also never reach these pursuits but that's what makes things exciting.

The purpose of a "guru" is to swindle you until you get wise enough to no longer be fooled by tricks.

Where you reach a point when you just need to put your head down and work.

If you don't mind taking the long way, obstacles insignificant and when you're moving slowly, you have the appropriate amount of time and space to make wise decisions.

This blog was started in 2012 and this note is in 2018. 

Everything I tried to rush ended in failure.

Most of the opportunities that promise near instant results don't end well.

In the last six years everything I did slowly was successful.

I learned how to cook like a proper home chef.

I became fit and strong.

I became a cyclist.

I learned how to sell effectively.

I built a blog with 10k followers.

I learned how to meditate.

I learned how to draw.

I've become really effective at different jobs.

I have learned how to manage my resources really well.

All these have been accomplished by going slowly. 

There's more I'm trying to do but I'm not in a rush to get there.

I'm trying to get used to chaining double-unders. 

I'm trying to get my Deadlift up from 365 lbs to 400 lbs.

I'm training for another 160km bike ride.

Whenever possible I no longer tell people about my goals. 

I'll talk about that in another post.

I'll see you on the other updates.
