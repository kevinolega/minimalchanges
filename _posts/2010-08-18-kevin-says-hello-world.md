Hi, I just started the blog <a href="http://minimalchanges.com/" target="_self">minimal changes</a>.  My blog is about changing your life using minimal changes. As most of us know or have tried progress in leaps and bounds had been the norm and the thing is although speed is attractive it is also pretty hard to maintain and as a result we get frustrated with our growth even if we are actually growing. I invite you to apply the lessons you can learn from this blog to help improve your situation. Please note that most of the lessons here are results of trial and mostly error so the advice might not be perfect but hopefully you can make things work  soon enough. Just be patient with yourself and know that minimal changes over time can eventually get you where you want to go. Feel free to look around and check <a href="http://minimalchanges.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">my links</a>, where I normally put <a href="http://http//minimalchanges.tumblr.com">interesting stuff I find</a>.
