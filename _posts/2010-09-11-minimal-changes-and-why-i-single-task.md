> "One on one is not just for fighting."

In martial arts, when one reaches a certain skill level, he or she learns how to deal with multiple attackers.

The concept of handling multiple people at the same time scares a lot of people because more people attacking you is a way bigger problem than one person attacking you.

The idea of fighting at such an unfair disadvantage and walking away unscathed is unrealistic.

It's not impossible but some people can do it.

Now if you're put into a situation where you have to deal with multiple attackers and you have to fight for your life, then whether you have to fight for your life, you have to do it.

The struggle is no longer optional.

What's the difference between people who can and people who cant?

First things first.

The person who can, believe they can and the person who believe they can't, won't be able to.

I believe that things are different only in your mind. 

The second difference is that the person who can deal with multiple attackers know how to.

Let's discuss the "how to."

My old martial arts master taught me how to deal with multiple attackers.

As I gained more life experience, I realize that many of the "success strategies" that we pick up can, with careful consideration, be transferred over to other areas of your life.

The principles and steps that my old martial arts master taught me can also be used to deal with life's multiple attackers or life challenges which, like multiple attackers always gang up on us in real life.

If problems are like people, they all seem to come at you at the same time and hits us when and where we are not prepared.

That said, the wise thing to do is to keep preparing.

Our ability to deal with multiple attackers increase as we increase our ability to control ourselves increases.

We have natural reactions like, run, cower in fear, plead, barter, etc.

These all make sense when the situation calls for it, but when you are cornered, when things are a "must," when you need to "stand your ground," you need to control your response.

Mindfulness is useful.

Here are some steps for mindfulness:

1. Be aware of what is happening.
2. Be aware of your emotions.
3. Pay attention.
4. Do not allow your emotions to dictate your next action.

**Protocol 1: Try to resolve the conflict without fighting.**

In life you need to choose your battles.

If you can walk away from a task, commitment, obligation, do so immediately.

**Protocol 2: Position yourself in a situation where you are able to deal with the most important targets.**

Okay, now that you have identified, what you need to deal with, begin with striking the most important targets, preferably the bigger, more important targets in order to make the succeeding targets easier and easier. 

In video game fights, you start with the weak opponents, then opponents get stronger as you get stronger.

In real life, you become exhausted, the longer you fight, so it's important to deal with the most important targets first then deal with the smaller targets until you're finished.

If that is not possible, line up your targets and begin taking out what is closest to you and keep going until you are done.

When you line up your targets, it's important to deal with your targets one by one.

**Protocol 3: Apply the right technique, with the right amount of force at the right situation.**

In protocol 2, we've discussed how you get more tired as fights drag on. That said, it's important to do only what is necessary and not over-exert yourself.

Only attack when the conditions are in your favor.

_Note: Here's what I kept from the original version of this post._

Remember: Multi-tasking is BS and will get you killed in a real fight. 

Assess the situation.

Prioritize your targets. 

Take out your targets one by one. 

Discipline to single-task is the key.

Here's the truth about fighting multiple attackers:

This may or may not work. 

The good news is life’s challenges, unlike a real fight, are not a life and death situations and all setbacks are temporary so be sure to have fun as you take the hits so next time you can take out your challenges.

This post is shit. Well the idea seemed cool at the time, but I lacked the attention span to actually complete this post so I rewrote most of it today. 

I'm still not 100% happy with this post.

The reason being I still haven't applied these principles to real life as well as I liked.

I wrote this post in 2010. I was working in an office and did some field sales work. I had a girlfriend and a regular feature phone instead of a smartphone.

Now I have a laptop that I take anywhere with me, an iPhone, an iPod touch, an iPod Mini, an Android Phone and a Macbook Pro. I use Facebook way more often than I should. I have other social media profiles and pages that I've uploaded. YouTube binge watching is a thing now and there are videos on Instagram. I'm more distracted than ever.

If this was a real fight, with multiple attackers, I'd be punched in the face, stabbed then I'd be slowly bleeding to death in an alley.

I've missed deadlines because of my easy access to the above technologies.

I'm going back to my daily practice of trying to find mastery over these elements.

I'm practicing meditation and getting into "deep work" before any distractions.

I realize that my blog is my own social network and I should prioritize this.

I've rambled on.

See you on the next post.
