No matter how important or beautiful we think anything is, we must realize that everything is temporary

When I was a kid, I used to think that I should always have enough and enough means lots of it. At this point you would say wait, enough of what? Lots of what? My answer would be enough of everything from clothes, to stuff, to information, training, etc. Pack rat upgrade junkie. I used to think this way, most of the  time and I realized that, so do most of the people I get to talk to. I’m just a bit more anal than most people. When I went for a minimalist lifestyle, I realized that its ok to actually have stuff. The general rule I keep is if I use it regularly I keep my stuff but if I see my a small part of my stuff piling up I should start to declutter. I ended up disposing 90% of my stuff in the process and it was fun. I deciced to get rid of my urge to keep more stuff than I need to. My hoarder dark side asked me this question that stopped me in my tracks:

What should I do if I need something and I don’t have it?

My answer: Look for it.

Most of the time, the things we really need are available. The reality, based on my experience is that if you really need it you’ll find it.

Instead of keeping and updating a large database of business prospects, just look for new ones and keep the ones that you like. Although discarding sounds wasteful, keeping too much weighs us down.

The idea that we need to keep a lot stems from out belief that there is not enough for everyone. Matter of fact is there is more than enough. We just feel that we don’t because we hold on too tightly on what we have even if its more of a hassle than its worth.

Try it for a day. Try it for a week. Just try it.

Here’s a short list of things I’m sure you can find if you look for:
<ol>
	<li>New prospects</li>
	<li>New clients</li>
	<li>Information about topics you need</li>
	<li>Specific clothes/accessories.</li>
	<li>Inspiration</li>
	<li>New Ideas</li>
	<li>Areas of improvement</li>
	<li>Reasons to smile</li>
	<li>Blessings in your life</li>
	<li>Reasons to thank God</li>
</ol>
Its ok to declutter and get rid of the unimportant because if you need anything you can find it. You can borrow or at the very worst, you can buy. I would suggest the cheaper alternative of course. Lighter load leads to a smoother travel. Don’t be afraid to let go because you can always find what you need.
