I’m from the Philippines and we just had our election. 

This is one of the posts that I’m sure is not for everyone, but I’ll write it anyway.

Frankly, I’m disappointed because the situation hasn’t improved and people don’t really care what happens to the country.  

Save a small group of people, everyone else seems to be apathetic about the situation. 

As long as they are unaffected by "negative changes", most people don’t care. 

I have to admit. 

I also belong to this category.

Listening to election speeches sure got me excited. 

I don’t know about you, but have you ever experienced being promised something bit later on realized that the sweet, sweet words were said to you only because the person needed your support at the moment?

We go through life supporting these kinds of individuals these are the Politicians, Educational System, Marketing from big companies, etc. 

I’m not naive. 

I just believe that some people want to change things for the better. 

I’ve met several of them. 

I also learned from the experience that it doesn’t matter who leads. 

Most people are not going to care anyway. 

All the time, I was complaining I forgot that people like you and me can change the world and are fully capable to do so.

There are several ways to change the world. 

Its just that we can't reach everybody. 

You might say it’s pretty big talk, but its up to you. 

I believe things can change. 

It might take time but we can change the world. 

We don’t need to change everyone. 

We just need to change ourselves. 

Some of that good will eventually reach a few people around us.

You are welcome to form your own strategy. 

My strategy, however, is to change myself and inspire only a few others to change as well. 

Its not easy, but it’s very simple.

**Apply a minimalist lifestyle**

This is the first and most important step because when you are free, you really have the power to choose and based on experience, applying a minimalist lifestyle is the way to get freedom using the least amount of resources. 

Live on less. 

[Try the 100 things challenge][1].

**Focus on the important**

We really don’t need a lot. 

What will make us happy is just an important few. 

Work on that.

Work with that. 

Make it a point to do just that and avoid distractions.

**Learn to say “No”**

Everyone wants us to do something. 

We say yes too quickly because we want to please everyone. 

I believe that you are God’s channel of blessing and inspiration. 

Please be responsible with your powers and make sure you take care of the important people to you first before your friends or job. 

Teach them that you are not saying no to offend them. 

You are saying no in order to accommodate the people important to your life.

**Free up your budget**
Having problems about not having enough cash to go for what matters? 

Free up your budget by trading the unimportant for the important.

Do you have financial problems?

You don't need expert advice.

You just need basic advice that you will apply to your life.

- List your expenses and include everything so you can make smarter decisions in future purchases.
- Look for things to stop spending money on.
- Eliminate expenses slowly. Start with what you can eliminate now and look for expenses that you would like to trade for extra cash.

**Free up your schedule**

Not enough time? 

I bet you’re spending time somewhere else. 

If thats the case, find out if what you’re doing is really important. 

Time is more important than cash. 

If you lose time you can’t get it back. 

Look for ways to free up your time. 

The good news is same principles for freeing up cash can for freeing up your time.

Begin to eliminate activities, commitments, appointments, that are neither profitable nor enjoyable. 

One reason why we are overwhelmed and time-deprived is that we have overcommitted to a lot of low-value activities.


**Live the kind of life that you want to inspire others to have**

People wont believe you unless you had results. 

Results never lie and as bad as it may sound people do judge what you say based on what you have.

 I’m not talking about stuff. 

I’m talking about the quality of life. 

It’s different for everyone but eventually people who like what you have will see you and want to have what you have. 

The best part is when they see you living their dream life, you actually proved that it’s possible for them. 

Lead by example. 

While it is true that: comparison is the thief of joy, an innocent comparison, not intending to prove who has the better deal, will allow one to see what is possible if he or she follows a similar strategy.

**Use minimal changes**

Free yourself up bit by bit. 

Change takes time. 

Learn to be patient.\</li\>


**Use what you have**

You don’t need to buy anything to have a great life. 

You already have a lot of things. 

In fact maybe you have too much and would need less. 

This is the best way for you to practice your problem solving skills.

Be resourceful.

The best tools are the ones you have on you at the moment.


**Do what you can**

There are a lot of things we can’t do yet.

 If we are faithful with the small things we can do great things. 

Start changing your life by doing what you can. 

I started with the small things and learned how to apply my powers effectively. 

You can too if you do what you can.


**Enjoy the benefits of a minimalist lifestyle**

Although our purpose is that we are put here to do great things, we must not forget to stop and enjoy the fruit of our work. 

When I was a workaholic. 

I never enjoyed my results because I didn’t enjoy my results. 

As soon as I had achieved a goal, a new and bigger goal took its place. 

I just kept adding goals to my list. 

Unfortunately, my goals involved just buying things at this point.

Five years of doing so lead to hopelessness and burnout. 

When you achieve a goal, celebrate and take a moment to be grateful with the results. 

Take some time to dwell on it.

**Inspire others**

No need to convince people. 

Just live your life. 

If you followed the steps above this part should be easy.

**Expect slow growth**

Things take time. 

Share your story when people ask you what you did, tell them. 

Offer suggestions when asked. 

Teach remarkable people. 

Always remember that you only need to change yourself and when people see the benefit they will act if its for them. 

Never force people. 

Focus on working on yourself.  

The rest will follow.

If you change your habits, you can change your self.

If you change your self, you can change your results.

If you change your results, you can change others.

A changed life is the best testimony that can stir a change in direction.

**Updated Wednesday, August 29, 2018 and notes from Kevin of the present date.**

I mades some corrections to the formatting and added some specificity to some of my statements.

I'm still 100% on this. 

Especially with the "use what you have" advice.

I've been struggling. 

I've experienced some form of financial success and "upgrading" my tools has distracted me from my purpose on this blog.

This blog was started on scrap paper, written on commutes and borrowed computers.

Today I am armed to the tooth, with a Macbook Pro, iPhones and a whole bunch of tech toys.

Everything I've written in the "Do what you can" sections came true.

I've made the most with what I have and I've been upgrading no matter how bad things got for me.
