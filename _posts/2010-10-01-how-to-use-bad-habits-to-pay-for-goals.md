<em>I’ll do what I previously won’t so I’ll have what my old self wont.</em>

I believe that everything we have, both good and bad can be used for good. In a previous gig I had to talk to several people and interview them to check if they have goals and to find out if we could assist them.  After interviewing about 3,000 people I found out that more than half of them had goals and interestingly enough, some were willing to work and some were not willing to work for their goals. Most of them agreed that they have something like a bad habit or a self-defeating mindset that’s pulling them down or holding them back, preventing them from reaching their goals.

Let’s admit it. We’re not perfect. We’re not some bozo pretending to be zen-like or enlightened saying without no problems, Everyone has issues and the good news is all problems have solutions.

Whether we admit it or not there are wrong beliefs and right beliefs. I’ll respect yours and I wont debate you. I’ll just share a wrong belief I had that I changed recently.

When we talk about bad habits, we’re looking for things we absolutely live but would not quit. Let’s be honest. We can quit it but we won’t because of some emotional attachment to it. We’re too attached to it we will never discuss it in public or we’ll stand by it and fight tooth and nail to keep it. Our bad habits are our percieved limitations and are impossible.

Wen we talk about dreams these are our goals that are so far out or impossible, we just call them. Something we see as too far to reach or impossible.

In the end we view out bad habits as weaknesses that chains  us to out current situations. The definitions are so dramatic I just want to cry.

If you think about it, everyone has dreams and everyone has bad habits. Both contain the word impossible. For a lot of us both are impossible. Which make it beautiful.

How can this be? How can this be the solution.

You can compromise to your advantage or you can compromise to your disadvantage. I don’t mean giving up your dream to retain your bad habit. That’s what you’ve been doing for a long time.

I suggest using your bad habit as a payment to achieve your dreams.

Compromise does not mean having both. Compromise means you trade or swap one for the other. Some say Rich and successful people chose both/and instead of either/or and it all has something to do with our capacity, but i disagree here. I don’t want my crap and my food sitting in the same place.

<strong>Here are some examples.</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Swap wanting for more and use what you have.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap waiting for the right time and do what you can.</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Finances:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Trade your bad habit of spending on useless stuff to pay for your goals.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap spending on low priced items for expensive items that you really want and need and will use.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap servicing bad and needy clients for fun and paying clients.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap accumulating debt for accumulating cash.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Work/Business:</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap spending on useless things and focus on selling products and servicing clients.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap spending on toys and start investing in people.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap unproductive activities for productive ones.</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Health:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Swap junk-food for a superhuman fit body.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap your rice and sweets addiction for a great shape.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap eating cholesterol rich foods like pork and oil for a superhuman heart.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap smoking for inhuman endurance and stamina.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap your fat for achieving peak human abilities.</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Relationships:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>For people important to you: Swap facebook/twitter for real life interactions.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>For people who are not important to you: Swap face to face interactions for Email, facebook or twitter.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap the one night stands for true love.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap the get laid quick strategies for finding your partner for life</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Family:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Swap socializing time with unimportant people for time with your family.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap excess work time/friend time for family time.</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Spiritual:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Swap tv time for time for God.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap your religion for a relationship with God.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap selfish habits for godly habits.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap converting others through words and debates to living a life worthy of the Gospel.</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Goals:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Swap the pay increase for location and time indepencende.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap the car and the house for travel around the world with cash to spare.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap the predictable secure career for the ability to make your own money.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap the stress for cash and time.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap the games for more time.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap being busy for time for what matters.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap consumerism and materialism for minimalism.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap stuff for people.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap feeding your ego or being right for keeping people who matter.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap serving your mortal boss for serving God.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Swap being an asshole for being nice.</strong></li>
</ul>
Most people would rather have both. I perefer to choose and keep one. Make your own list of things to swap. If you have a lot of bad habits thats great news you have more things to swap for your dreams.

What can I say? I have a bad habit of creating bad habits that will bring me closer to my goals.
