<em>And to think I used to be such a shy bastard.</em>

<strong>Post written by </strong><a href="http://minimalchanges.com/blog/about"><strong>Kevin Olega</strong></a><strong>. Follow me on </strong><a href="http://twitter.com/kevinolega"><strong>twitter.</strong></a>

When I started college, I didn’t know what course to pick. I didn’t know what career path to follow. I didn’t know what kind of life I want. Like everyone else at my level back then I let my parents decide.

I can’t remember what the situation was but I got this advice from my half-sister. We didn’t talk much so I remembered her advice pretty well since its the only actual conversation I remember.

<strong>Here’s the advise:</strong>

<strong>“If you’re having trouble deciding where you want to go, try listing down what you’re good at and note which ones you like while trying things out and chose from there.”</strong>

My list at age 16-17

I liked writing

I liked talking to people

I liked drawing

I liked martial arts ( I liked fighting but I don’t enjoy hurting people)

I liked adding new skills to my list.

At that age I never realized that the advice would get me to where I am today. I started with a job in sales and was eventually invited by different companies to work for them. I landed a gig in a training school. I got mentored by successful people in sales, marketing, business development, people development and website creation. I also have been blessed to acquire a whole bunch of skills and trainings at a young age.

Later on I realized that it’s not the course you took in the university that will bring you where you want to go. You can just use what you have right now.

Where I am right now, I’m confident I can make any business flourish, help people figure out solutions to their problems, get any job if I need to and teach you how to do the same.

Here’s how to get Started.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Write a list of things you are good at.-</strong> Write as many as you can my first list included kicking ass and battlefield strategies.</li>
	<li><strong>Pick what you enjoy doing.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Write a list of accomplishments.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Write a list of positive adjectives about yourself </strong>and think of a story to correspond with it.</li>
	<li>Write a list of failures.-<strong>then write a list of life lessons.</strong></li>
	<li>Write a list of weaknesses – now you <strong>have a list of areas to improve on.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Write a list of jobs you took</strong> – now write <strong>a list of things you can contribute to others as a result of taking on those jobs.</strong></li>
</ul>
My advice:

<strong>Use what you have and do what you can, then package it in a way that it can contribute to others. Then you’ll never worry about getting clients or finding a gig.</strong>
