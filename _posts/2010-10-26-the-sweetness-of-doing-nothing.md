A few days ago. I spent the week end at my friend’s house. I’ve been thinking of going somewhere to disappear to. A small town in the Philippines perhaps unfortunately I couldn’t decide where and nobody’s available. Long story short my friend was available  so I went there.

<strong>Minimalist Birthday Party</strong>

To my surprise they threw a small party for my and have me a minimalist gift. <strong>Nothing</strong> fancy really but its very memorable and its the most fun I had in a long time.

My favorite part? Just us, a couple of drinks, stories. I’ve been to a lot of parties but for me this is what I want. Too often we are consumed with the distractions and formalities of what a party should be. I beg to differ.

We hanged out and talked mostly. It was the most fun I had in a long time.

<strong>The empty room</strong>

They let me stay in an empty room with just a sofa-bed and a beautiful lamp where they left me to write and do <strong>nothing</strong>. The best part was that the change of scene allowed me to rethink my strategies and priorities. Its amazing what spending time in an empty room with a lot of free space can do to you. At that moment I felt peace, clear thinking and relaxed attitude which was nice. I ended up thinking, writing and just bumming around while in the empty room.

<strong>The Change of Scene</strong>

The change of scene allowed me to be refreshed and excited about what to do next with my life. I even got to sort out my plans and I’m fairly optimistic about life in general. I ended up deciding to do this at least once a month.

<strong>The <strong>Sweetness</strong> of <strong>Doing</strong> <strong>Nothing</strong></strong>

Overall my weekend was fantastic. I’ve been living my life creating habits and forming routines to automate boring tasks and stuff like that and I learned that breaking routines were so much fun. Last night I got myself a bottle of an Alcomix drink and got one before going to sleep. I lookforward to <strong>doing</strong> more things like these and sharing my stories about it.

What routines do you plan to break to enjoy the <strong>sweetness</strong> of <strong>doing</strong> <strong>nothing</strong>?
