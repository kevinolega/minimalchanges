When you try yo make the most by <a href="http://minimalchanges.com/blog/do-what-you-can-use-what-you-hav/">using what you have and doing what you can</a> you already stepped into a new level of self-mastery where your creativity, perseverance and mental endurance are greatly enhanced.

When you <a href="http://minimalchanges.com/blog/the-beauty-of-limitations/">try to work your way with limitions </a>you bring out the best in yourself. Here’s a challenge you might want to try out. Try this only if you want to take things up a notch higher. I won’t force you. You dictate how fast you grow as I did mine. I feel that if you really think about these things you’ll be able to understand it on your own and I don’t have to explain it. I trust that you’ll be able to find answers on your own so I’ll spare you the boring details.

<strong>The Challenge, and some guidelines.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Never Complain both in your words and in your thoughts.</li>
	<li>Cursing is not allowed.</li>
	<li>If you can influence your situation do so withour complaining.</li>
	<li>If you can not influence your situation you can just be optimistic that things will turn out fine. (Trust me, God loves you)</li>
</ul>
<em>Consider it a sheer gift, friends, when tests and challenges come at you from all sides. You know that under pressure, your faith-life is forced into the open and shows its true colors. So don’t try to get out of anything prematurely. Let it do its work so you become mature and well-developed, not deficient in any way.</em><em>-James1:2-4</em>

Most of the time the situation does not need to be changed or be forced to change. You just need to change oe force yourself to change and/or learn the life lesson and move on.
