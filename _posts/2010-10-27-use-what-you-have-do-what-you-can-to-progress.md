<em>Fear not the weapon but the hand that wields it! – Ninja Assassin (2009)</em>

I’m an ex- consumerist zombie pack-rat. I hoard everything. Mostly stuff I plan to use later that I end up never using. I saw my security from having a pile of stuff that I can use or having an army of resources at my disposal. If the latest gadget came up it makes me drool and always make me want to think of a way for it to be of use for me achieve complete goal domination! This mindset had prevented me from achieving my goals.

I usually tell myself something like this. If I have “X-GADGET” then I can have “X-GOAL!” Wrong answer! Its an excuse I keep telling myself. Something I never wanted to admit until I saw things differently.

The problem with relying on tools is that there is always a new tool every so often. So we waste cash and time comparing tools and we waste money buying upgrades. Waiting for an upgrade before moving forward spells PROCRASTINATION.

What if insteady of wasting money on the new upgrade you can just go ahead and use what you have right now? Just try to get things done with what you have right now. You can right? Its not like you can’t do it without the upgrade.

I bet it doesn’t really take a lot to accomplish things. Use some of your creativity and you’re good to go.

Maybe you’ve been wanting to be an entrepreneur or to be a great leader or to think and act like a CEO.

Here’s your chance. With your current goals and challenges or in an area that you would like to progress ask yourself the following questions:
<ul>
	<li>How do I pull of the task/project by using only what I have?</li>
	<li>What can I do to move forward and progress with what I am currently doing?</li>
	<li>How do I keep moving forward despite my limitations without buying anything?</li>
</ul>
