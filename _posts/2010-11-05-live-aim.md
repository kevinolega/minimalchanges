<em>What would be the best way to get started other than just getting started?</em>

Where I come from it is a common saying that I only want the simple life. I don’t need a grand life to be happy. Yet a lot of people do voice out their dissatisfaction with work, income and life in general. It is a common sight for people to take 2 or more jobs ot to work a job they don’t want to gain a higher income and more often than not you hear people say <strong>I want the simple life, then I’ll be happy, then they work jobs they hate and buy stuff they don’t need.</strong>

I’m sure you’re not that kind of a person. You simply know people like that.

Here’s a question.

<strong>If a practice is practiced by a lot of people and that lot of people are clearly unhappy would you continue to do it?</strong>

Here’s are suggestions I’m proposing. I’m trying it out myself.
<ul>
	<li>Instead of aiming for a simple life just live the simple life.</li>
	<li>Live the life you have right now and simplify bit by bit.</li>
	<li>Try to live on less.</li>
	<li>Don’t buy a lot of crap.</li>
	<li>Get rid of stuff you don’t really use.</li>
	<li>Spend time on people and not on toys.</li>
	<li>Don’t work on increasing your income until you spend less than you earn.</li>
</ul>
