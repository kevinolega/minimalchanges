<div>Want to take what you’re doing up another notch? **Just play with it.**</div>
<div>**
**</div>
<div>** **Seriously. Thats the advice. You’re always fiddling with something. Why not go fiddling with the work you love?</div>
<div>When you’re playing you risk more. When you learn to play and want to win you take more calculated risks instead of more calculations. **In a game there’s no life threatening mistakes and surprisingly its the same with real life.**</div>
<div>Try more and win more when you play. **When you play there’s no worries about losing.** You can always try again. Same with life.</div>
<div>Whether you win or lose you learn and have fun.That’s what matters. **You probably know this already so go back to playing.**</div>
