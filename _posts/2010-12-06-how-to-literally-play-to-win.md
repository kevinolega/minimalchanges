<div>Want to take what you’re doing up another notch? <strong>Just play with it.</strong></div>
<div><strong>
</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong>Seriously. Thats the advice. You’re always fiddling with something. Why not go fiddling with the work you love?</div>
<div>When you’re playing you risk more. When you learn to play and want to win you take more calculated risks instead of more calculations. <strong>In a game there’s no life threatening mistakes and surprisingly its the same with real life.</strong></div>
<div>Try more and win more when you play. <strong>When you play there’s no worries about losing.</strong> You can always try again. Same with life.</div>
<div>Whether you win or lose you learn and have fun.That’s what matters. <strong>You probably know this already so go back to playing.</strong></div>
