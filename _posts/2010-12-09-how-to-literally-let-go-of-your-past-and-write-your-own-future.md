When you look at yourself for areas to improve its easy to dwell into past hurts, failures, events of regret which would lead to bitterness or worse, paralysis.

Two options might work.
<ul>
	<li>Option One – You either write down your drama and try to sell it to a soap opera story writer or better produce your own.</li>
	<li>Option Two – is that you can ditch the whole drama thing and just move on with your life. You can write a story (pick up what you want to improve and then just get started)</li>
</ul>
Write your future instead of dwelling in the past.
