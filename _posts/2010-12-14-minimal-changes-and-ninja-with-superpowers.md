I’m starting off with a new series about superpowers. Here are things you probably don’t know about me yet.
<ul>
	<li>I’m a geek.</li>
	<li>I get bored easily.</li>
	<li>Most of the tasks I do either bores me to death or scares me to death.</li>
	<li>Most tasks are really fun.</li>
	<li>I probably just have ADHD which could explain why I get bored easily.</li>
	<li>I’m scared when it’s time to get serious.</li>
	<li>I’m kick-ass effective when I’m just playing around with it.</li>
	<li>I started calling my techniques Ninjutsu or Super Powers</li>
	<li>I started lableing my weakness my weaknesses which I overcame with my Superpowers.</li>
	<li>I started copying superpowers from everywhere and used them to murder a task, cripple my weakness, eliminate clutter, complete my missions.</li>
	<li>I’m starting to write about it in this <strong>blog</strong>.</li>
	<li>I hope you’ll like it</li>
</ul>
