If you do suck at something long enough you’ll be good at it.

Insanity is doing things over and over again expecting different results. Its true but as humans we cant do anything over and over again so we’re bound to tweak what we’re doing with every attempt. With each attempt we learn what we did. I made a promise to enjoy my every weakness and stay with it because I know that after prolonged exposure it will be one of my next key strengths. So just keep at you’re weaknesses.

My mentor told me that in every obstacle “<strong>the answer is always there, you just haven’t found it yet.”</strong>

I believe so too and I’m confident that if you work on what you’re doing without worrying about your weakness you’ll find a way. Weakness can become strength.

<strong>Do something long enough, like 1-2 years and you’re called an amateur. An amateur with 3-5 years of experience can get things done. An amateur with more than 5 years of experience can do anything with his eyes closed.</strong>

Did you know that I used to believe the following statements:
<ul>
	<li>I’m a shy person</li>
	<li>I don’t have a lot of friends</li>
	<li>I’m disorganized</li>
	<li>I can’t sell</li>
	<li>I’m bad at handling cash</li>
	<li>I’m a weakling</li>
	<li>I’m not fit</li>
	<li>I can’t win a fight if my life depended on it</li>
	<li>I’ll never quit smoking</li>
	<li>I’ll never become fit.</li>
	<li>I’ll never lose weight.</li>
	<li>My life will never get cleaned up.</li>
</ul>
