I actually wrote this post end of December 2010

2010 was a turning point in my life. It's the day I adapted a minimalist lifestyle, started blogging, setup my online based business, and started to be a part of the new rich. These transitions didn't happen overnight. Some were hard and some were easy. Minimal Changes is born out of a strategy to work consistently in the slow track and building toward an ergonomically optimum progression which is simply just a fancy way of saying moving toward my goals in a slow but consistent manner.

As the year ends I'd like to think back on all the blessings and changes I've had this year. I actually just started writing these down today so most of the things here are things from the top of my head so I'll hope you excuse me if the order may be a bit disorganized.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Grey Jacket</strong> - This is actually my first casual jacket I've bought. Most of the stuff in my wardrobe is formal/corporate type.</li>
	<li><strong>Havianas Flip Flops</strong> - most of my stuff is corporate so this new aproach to my wardrobe excited me. Wearing slippers when going out reminds me to slow down and enjoy life</li>
	<li><strong>Didn't add a lot of stuff</strong> - this used to be impossible for me because I used to be really excited by buying a lot of stuff.
Started Minimal Changes. - Minimal Changes is this blog you're reading right now where I talk about duh Minimal Changes and concepts like trying to make progress without any purchase and changing your life by starting where you are, using what you have and doing what you can.</li>
	<li><strong>Started Philippine Island Living</strong>. - <a href="http://www.philippineislandliving.com/">Philippine Island Living</a> is a place where I document opportunities to find life, love and retirement in the Philippines</li>
	<li><strong>Became a minimalist</strong> - biggest change of my life. I used to be a hoarder and I believed that stuff is a status symbol and I collected trash because I might need it later. Now I enjoy applying minimalism which resulted in a cleaner and easier to organize, simplified life, mind and surroundings.</li>
	<li><strong>Lost 1 inch off my waistline this December</strong>. -something I couldnt believe I learned. I'll post about this later on.</li>
	<li><strong>Dropped projects.</strong> - I was working myself on too many things and was spreading myself too thin. Now I'm actually focused and effective at what I do.</li>
	<li><strong>Had more time</strong>. -The best part of dropping projects isn't really the effective focus. Now I am able to do what's important to me. Like spending time with my family and close friends.</li>
	<li><strong>Started getting positive results</strong>. - Slowing down and doing things one thing at a time actually allowed me to move forward bit by bit. The creativity just rushes out of me when I slow down.</li>
	<li><strong>Learned to do things manually</strong> - Because of my sales background, know that a product/service is a solution to a problem. Nothing's wrong with the belief save for the part where I abused it to the point that every time I needed something done, I'd just think about where it can be outsourced and what do I need to buy which was mostly a waste since I can do most of it manually for free.</li>
	<li><strong>Started to have discipline</strong>. - Single tasking is the hardest exercise to learn discipline. It’s so easy to jump to working on the urgent and unimportant. Now that I do things one at a time, the discipline spilled over to different areas of my life as well and I'm glad I took that step.</li>
	<li><strong>Regained my ability to say no</strong>.  - I used to be a Yes man. Anything you need, I'd say anything for you. My yes's got me too much stuff on my plate and I never got to get things done because of my scattered focus and lack of time.</li>
	<li><strong>Became self-sufficient with the small things.</strong> - It's the skills and not the tools that make you effective. Since I'm not relying on tools I also decided not to outsource a whole bunch of other stuff like laundry, dishwashing, cooking and other housework. In fact it's actually fun and fulfilling.</li>
	<li><strong>Stayed in a condo</strong> - I got myself a place that's walking distance from work which gave me more time for myself and I learned how to be independent again.</li>
	<li><strong>Got out of credit card debt</strong>. - this was a tricky part but I'm glad I'm over this. I actually use a debit card now. But since my goal is to save up some moolah for some of my goals I still don’t use it that much.</li>
	<li><strong>Started nurturing relationships</strong>. - I used to have crappy relationships because I'm too goal oriented I step on people to get what I want.</li>
	<li><strong>Became responsible</strong> - nuff said.</li>
	<li><strong>80% out of debt </strong>– I did it by avoiding things that did not contribute to my life and my goals.
Started to have follow-through – I used to be a good starter but bad at finishing. I learned to stop activities that didn’t help and completed activities that are important.</li>
	<li><strong>Became healthy</strong> – stopped smoking and ate healthy.</li>
	<li><strong>Became organized</strong> – this became easy once I became a minimalist.
<strong>Became someone my 2009 version would look up to</strong>. – Woohoo!
<strong>Became financially free</strong>. – Yes I am financially free. I don’t have debt, I spend a lot less than I earn and I have income from businesses.</li>
</ul>
