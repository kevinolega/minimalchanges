I used to start the year with a lot of goals. This is how I’d describe my 2011:
Minimal waste expenses
Savings for my 2012 wedding
Giving to the poor and or volunteering
Zero debt

Some stuff I would like at year end:
60 things left.
Learn to play guitar
A trip out of the city for a week.
Be location independent at work
A certain number in my bank account
Not buying stuff I don’t need (clothes, gadgets, phone upgrades etc.)

My Goal Setting abilities for the past few years were terrible. They were terribly exactly the goal setting strategies in success books. I have big goals, mostly material goals that are aimed to please people I don't like. I have a long list, sort of like a bucket list. I'm also going to work on my goals as fast as I can to get them as soon as I can because I might die at any moment. Most material goals are aimed to curb my insecurities. This year as I had attempted in the middle of 2010 I'm changing the rules.

1. I'm going to play with it.
2. I'm going to do what I like and contribute to others at the same time.
3. I'll try to go as slow as I can.
4. I won’t spend a lot of time on material goals - I'll have a separate list of nice to haves.
5. I will not be buying unnecessary things as much as I can.
6. I'll accomplish my goals on my own terms.
7. No compromise
How do you plan to setup your year?
