Many people say that the grass is greener on the other side. Unfortunately wherever you go you bring yourself with you. So whatever happens in your life that’s crappy its probably because you brought it to your life and until you change things don’t change.

This is a really short post but I want you to act on this.

**Don’t try to fix others
Try to fix yourself.
Don’t expect big changes.
Learn to be patient.
Start bending reality with a small change in you.
If you can try a minimal change then you have the superpower to change the world.**
