The cool thing about not having facebook is I had more time. Attention is the most important resource we have. What are you doing with your time? What are you paying attention to?

In my previous post. I wrote about <a href="http://minimalchanges.com/blog/why-i-chose-to-live-without-facebook/">me quitting facebook</a>.Its interesting how <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/evbogue">Everett Bogue</a> of <a href="http://www.farbeyondthestars.com/">Far Beyond the Stars</a> wrote about the <a href="http://www.farbeyondthestars.com/the-facebook-exodus-and-the-future-of-human-communication/">Exodus from Facebook</a> the same week I quit facebook. I was wondering what it meant. Maybe people are realizing that they have a life and they need to pay attention to it.

What's really interesting is that when I was announcing to my friends that I'm quitting facebook and that I was worried that I'd lose contact with some of the people I enjoyed talking to. Its cool that I made more friends in the process. People I was close to kept in touch through email. Some acquaintances who I never thought I had anything in common with came out some through email and some followed me on twitter. When I left facebook I had a lot of facebook likes on my blog from my friends.

Now I have more time to do the things that are important. Some of the people who tried to stop me told me that I was missing a lot and losing things from quitting facebook. What did I really lose? I'd like to encourage you to make your own list and no I'm not asking you to delete your facebook account. I can't make you do anything you don't want to do.

Just in case you're curious about what it's like to not have a facebook account, here's what I lost by quitting facebook.

1. I don't know what everyone in my network is thinking, eating, buying, going to, and feeling.

2. If someone is feeling down I'm not affected because I don't see it in my wall.

3. I have one less distraction when I go online.

4. I don't get to spend a day reminiscing about my past or stalking people I haven't seen in a long time.

5. I don't check around to see if people I'd like to talk to are online in facebook chat.

6. I lost my ability to just login to facebook and stare at the facebook.

7. I don't have to think of a status message, like or share a link, Untag marketing images I get tagged in and so on.

8.I get to disappear from the world of people I don't really care about.

Heck, the people I care about have stayed in touch with me even before I had facebook so I don't think anything's still going to change. So there you have it. This post is starting to sound like a facebook hater's post so I'll stop right here. I just cant believe how cool it is to finally loosen this burden from facebook.

What's so great about life after facebook? Its simple really. I have one less thing to check and I have more time and attention to spend on people who are important.

<strong>I'm writing this blog because I believe you are important.</strong> Now with everything said and done, let's move on with life as I prepare to write my next post. Hopefully something you could really learn from.
