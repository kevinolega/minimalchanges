If you're reading this blog, chances are you are working, for yourself, to gain experience and make some moolah. You're probably working on your own business, your own gig or working for a company.

There are times when you feel it's totally cool. So far, so good.

Have you ever felt like crap when:
<ul>
	<li>You look at your pay check      and it doesn't seem to be big enough (Business books say that the market      pays you what you're worth.) Therefore you're starting to feel like you      aren't worth much?</li>
	<li>You offer something mutually      beneficial like a product, service or partnership then a gate-keeper      shoots you down for some absurd reason and refuses to listen to you.</li>
	<li>You're applying for a gig or      a promotion then the low intelligence of someone kicks in and despite your      dazzling array or display of skills, working knowledge and experience they      kick you in the balls and refuse to hire you because of your lack of      formal education (yes an MBA), or what course you took in college (they      say it wasn't a match), lack of years in a certain field (does it really      take years to gage experience?) or the number of years doesn't match your      asking price.</li>
	<li>You put in long hours at      work and had became an expert in your job and you even volunteer your      extra time because you advocate what your company is all about but they      refuse to acknowledge you and worse your title stays the same despite      being a specialist, event-organizer, problem solver they still call you by      the position the HR trainee selected for you i.e. clerk, data encoder,      sales staff.</li>
	<li>You're prospect says the      product or service you're offering is good but they don't feel like paying      you what you're asking and smothers you with the excuse it doesn't seem to      be worth it.</li>
	<li>You look at your bank      account and things do not add up.</li>
</ul>
Shit balls.

I got shot down too. Life felt like it sucks. People are always imposing who you are and what you're worth and the worse part is that at one point I believed them.

I wrote a post about <a href="http://minimalchanges.com/how-to-be-awesomely-confident-for-shy-people-only/">How to be confident for shy people</a>. I sometimes write a list for what I have and what I can offer. No I do not mean cliché job interview answers or sales answers.

Let’s set the record straight:
<ul>
	<li>Yes the market pays you what      they think you're worth but they always aim to get it at the lowest      possible price and there are buggers who will use cheap shots to keep the      prices down.. There are too many people who will to waste your time on the      people who wont.</li>
	<li>Gatekeepers are gatekeepers.      Deal with it. Call again or go around them. Do not waste any time with      them. Continue offering what you have and if they don't listen offer it to      somebody else. The market is big enough. There are people looking for your      product or service and will gladly pay for it. If you're being shot down      or rejected then you're just barking at the wrong tree. Thank the people      who rejected you because you just used them for practice. Move on to the      next company.</li>
	<li>Some people do not see your      value because they are looking for something else. That’s a good thing. I      wouldn't want to imagine myself in a situation where I'll be working with      or for someone who doesn't respect me. Fire their asses. It’s a two way      relationship and should be mutually beneficial. Walk away from deals that      will make you miserable. Every moment you spend with the wrong one is time      wasted because you should spend it with the right people.</li>
	<li>You are not your bank      account. If you’re not happy with the money you have betted do something      about it. There are a lot of places to get ideas from but you have a brain      and I’m sure you’ll be able to use it. **Your ideas are better than someone else for your situation because nobody knows your situation like you do.**</li>
</ul>
The truth is that you're better than who you think you are. Just keep going.<a href="http://minimalchanges.com/how-to-be-a-talented-genius-in-whatever-you-want-to-learn/"> Things are a lot better once you hit your breakthrough so I'll wait for you on the other side.</a>
