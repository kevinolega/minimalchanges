Ingredients and tools allow you to play and playing helps us have fun. Some people end up obsessing with the kinds of tools they use, they forget to play and forget to have fun. It's okay to be both balanced and extreme. Just mix the two and have fun. Extreme strategies builds up thrills in life and balanced strategies lets you slow down and appreciate life. Both strategies are important so learn to be both extreme and balanced in moderation. The world will thank you for it.

Wouldn't it be nice if you can:

-Be a minimalist but not empty.
-Mindful but not anal.
-Clean but not obsessive compulsive.
-Strategic but not lazy.
-Action oriented but not reckless.
-A profitable entrepreneur without stepping on others.
-Share the gospel without being a psychotic evangelist.
-Assertive not cruel.
The thing is you're better off doing things and having fun.

Hereâ€™s my favorite line from the movie the Dark Knight.

<em>The Joker: Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it. You know, I just... do things. The mob has plans, the cops have plans, Gordon's got plans. You know, they're schemers. Schemers trying to control their little worlds. I'm not a schemer. I try to show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are.</em>

<em>Are your schemes preventing you from chasing your dreams?</em>
