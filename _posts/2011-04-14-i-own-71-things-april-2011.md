It's the time for another reevaluation and I'm counting how much stuff I own and figuring out what I'd like to get rid of. In case you're wondering I got the Idea to count my stuff from <a href="http://guynameddave.com/100-thing-challenge">Dave Bruno and the 100 Thing Challenge</a> and <a href="http://exilelifestyle.com">Collin of Exile Lifestyle</a>. After participating, I became more efficient and worried less. I'll write about it in another post.

Here's a list of my Less than 100 things. This is the fourth time I done this since I started <a href="http://minimalchanges.com">Minimal Changes</a> and this is the first time we'll have pictures of my stuff. Yay! I'm using my <a href="http://twitter.com/kristineangeles">friend's</a> camera for the shots.
Here's a bit of info about how I did it.
a. Items that function together count as one so the Laptop, batery, charger, and case counts as one item.
b. Consumables like toothpaste, facewash and other toiletries are not included since I change or replace them on a regular basis.
