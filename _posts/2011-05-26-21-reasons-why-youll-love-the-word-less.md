People hate the word less for some reason. I feel the reason is we believe we miss out on the good things life has to offer when we want less in life.

I grabbed the following quote from <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2881-any-intelligent-fool-can-make-things-bigger">Jason Freid’s blog</a> at 37 Signals:
<h4 style="text-align: center;">**“Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, **</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">**more complex, and more violent. **</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">**It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage—**</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">**to move in the opposite direction.”**</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">**—Albert Einstein**</h4>
Here are some of the things from the top of my head why I want to have less in my life:
<table border="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr align="center">
<td>Less Trash
Less complication
Less stress
Less clutter
Less distraction
Less wasted movement
Less waste</td>
<td>Less debt
Less expenses
Less fat
Less weight
Less travel time
Less wrinkles
Less blackheads</td>
<td>Less advertisements
Less loading time
Less unhealthy habits
less hate
Less hurt
Less fighting
Less herd mentality</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
What do you want less of?
