I have every reason to be happy and so do you. Sometimes... okay thats an exaggeration. A lot of times we feel disappointed or that life sucks. We gradually improve which is a guarantee. We hit our small goals regularly, but why are we unhappy?

Here's something I wrote down a while back and I hope you can use it for your situation.

Here it is:
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>"Maybe the reason why you're unhappy</strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;"><strong> is that the size of your goal </strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>is too big or your deadline is too short </strong></span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>or your goal is to please everybody."</strong></span></h4>
If that's the case better stop and re-evaluate your life. It's not worth it.

Ask yourself questions like:

Do I really need to go big?

Do I really want to stay on top?

Is it worth it?

&nbsp;

I'll leave the rest to you to figure out.
