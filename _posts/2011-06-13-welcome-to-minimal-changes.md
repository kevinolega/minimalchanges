Minimal Changes is where I write about how I improve my life
<blockquote>use what you have. do what you can.</blockquote>
I write mostly about:

<a href="http://minimalchanges.com/category/efficient-light-fast/">being efficient, light and fast</a>
<a href="http://minimalchanges.com/category/confidence-moving-forward/"> confidence and moving forward</a>,
<a href="http://minimalchanges.com/category/well-rounded-balance/"> balance and well roundedness</a>
<a href="http://minimalchanges.com/category/relationships/"> relationships</a>

<a href="http://minimalchanges.com/category/relationships/"></a>
After working on myself for a couple of years, I realized that I had everything I need and instead of reading books, attending seminars, getting mentored, I decided to just write my own material for my personal use and in case youâ€™re interested of finding out how I do these things, you can read them here as well.
