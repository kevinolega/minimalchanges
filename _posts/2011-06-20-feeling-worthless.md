Everyone has something to offer.

You just need to know what you have so you can use it.

Despite what most people say. I believe you’re valuable. You have all the reasons to believe you are. I can give you enough reference about it to kill you with boredom but I want you alive so I won’t do that.

Sometimes you might be worried about not having enough or not being the person you want to be.
<blockquote>Stop and Quit it!</blockquote>
Pause and think for a moment. What do I have that I can use well? What can I do that if I work on I can do well?

Got an answer?

That’s a start.

Now get out of here and see what you can do with it!
