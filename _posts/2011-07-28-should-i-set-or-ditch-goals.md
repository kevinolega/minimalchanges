There's been a lot of talk about setting and<a href="http://zenhabits.net/no-goal/"> not setting goals</a>. Some people say <a href="http://lifeexcursion.com/leo-babauta-goals/">you need goals and your intentions make your goals a reality</a>. Some people recommend <a href="http://zenhabits.net/achieving/">living in the moment</a> and enjoying the moment as things come while <a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/lifehacker/full/~3/LT5WMylYwUA/improve-your-luck-by-relaxing-keeping-an-open-mind-and-paying-attention-to-the-world-around-you">taking advantage of opportunities that come your way</a>.

Both strategies work for some people and both had made some people's lives miserable.

I believe you should pick what works for you.

After all no expert no matter what their credientials are can give you the right advice for your life. Nobody but God knows your situation better than you do. You, my friend, will be in-charge of giving you the advice and implementing it.

So what am I saying?

Try both and see what happens.

I generally use plans for direction and I try to keep myself flexible and not obsess over my plan. Doing so help me move on when things don't often go my way. I also try to enjoy evolving while being myself and doing what I need to do to move forward. One step at a time.

Let go and learn to smile will ya? :)
