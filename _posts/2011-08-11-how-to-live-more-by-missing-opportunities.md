A few people told me that they want to know what else is possible than living their lives just asking themselves "what if?" We now have all the options in the world and the common voice that’s being promoted is that “you can have it all.” But have you ever stopped and considered what would happen if we got everything what we wanted?

You see, we can have all this talk and debate but the thing is I’m pretty sure you also have a really short list of things you’d want to have and do as soon as you can and you’d be really happy.

I have a pretty short list too:
1. I’d like to be with the person I love, get married and start a family.
2. I’d like to get to support my mom and my little brother.
3. I’d like to make money by helping others with what I have. (Either through my job, my writing or by spending time with them)
4. I’d like to try out different foods, travel a bit and buy nice things once in a while.

It’s nothing really big. Then there’s talk about becoming a billionaire, becoming famous and a whole bunch of things we don’t really care about. Or at least I don’t.

Lofty, far out goals and plans seemed to have distracted us from the short list of what matters to us. Imagine this: A man leaves his wife to go overseas to work to save up extra so he can start a business and have enough investments to support a life in luxury with his soon to be ex-wife.

In sales and marketing we’re trained to teach our clients to want to have what we’re selling by teaching them not to miss out on the opportunity because if they buy they’ll insert benefit. I’m sure there’s a lot of benefit with your far off goals. I’m just wondering if it will bring you closer or farther away from what matters to you?
<blockquote><strong>In life, whether you like it or not, you’re going to miss a lot of opportunities. It’s okay. Sooner or later you might have to choose what to miss out on and sometimes it’s going to feel like you have no choice in the matter. Despite this, you will always have the opportunity to be present to the opportunities that really matter you as long as you chose not to miss them.</strong></blockquote>
I'm intentionally missing out on opportunities to make way for my short list. What are you intentionally missing out on?
