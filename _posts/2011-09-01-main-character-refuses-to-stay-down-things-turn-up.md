<span style="color: #000000;">Today seems to be a turning point. I’m not sure if you can call this a breakthrough. In the past few months I underwent the book of Job. I don’t mean reading it. I meant going through it. I feel like the main character in the story. I do not consider myself like Job but I seem to have understood him more by experiencing what seems to be a similar chain of events. My experience was not of biblical proportions but it seemed to be closer than anything biblical I can remember.</span>
<ul>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000;">My partner and I broke up.</span></li>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000;">A very special friend passed away (future step dad)</span></li>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000;">My mom lost her job.</span></li>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000;">The company I work for shut down.</span></li>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000;">A visitor from hell entered me through my mouth in a form of an impacted wisdom tooth that caused an infection that paralyzed my jaw for a few weeks and I couldn’t open my mouth to eat or talk.</span></li>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000;">My laptop broke down.</span></li>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000;">People who owe me money are suddenly disappearing.</span></li>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000;">And a whole bunch of things too disgusting to mention here.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #000000;">I felt like I’m going to lose my mind from it. Every event occurred a week after the other. I never got the chance to digest and assess the situation properly because of things happening too fast. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;"> I wanted to just curse God and die.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;"> Everything God has given, he has taken away. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;"> My favorite bible verses last year was from Isaiah 43 (Paraphrased)</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> When you pass through waters,</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> I will be with you and they will not sweep over you.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> You will walk through fire and not get burned.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> The flames will not set you ablaze.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> For I am the Lord, your God.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> You are precious in my sight and because I love you.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> When I act none can reverse it.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;"> My wall of protection seemed to have been removed at this point.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;"> An emotional whirlwind of anger, hate, acceptance, forgiveness, and depression soon followed. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;"> I want to become darkness.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;"> What stopped me is that <a href="http://minimalchanges.com/taking-my-minimal-changes-in-a-different-direction/">I knew that I was no</a>t.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">These things happen and it’s a waste of time if I look around trying to blame somebody or something else. If the wall of protection and floods of blessings are not present maybe it’s pulled out for maintenance. Or maybe I don’t really need it. I’ve been given a lot of blessings. Maybe it’s time I used that instead of waiting for future blessings. A great director (that would be God) knows when support needs to arrive for the main character (that would be me) in an adventure film (that would be my life story).</span>

<span style="color: #000000;"> I’m happy to share that things are now turning up.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> I received a major upgrade. (which I’ll talk about in the next posts)</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> I’m on my way to start working on something new.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">I started working on a new job.</span>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">My mom is finally accepting interviews.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://kevinolega.com"> kevinolega.com</a> is now up</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> I'm doing experiments from the 4 hour body.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> My laptop got fixed. (sort of)</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">The situation is now turning up.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> Expect more stories.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> I’ll see you soon.</span>
