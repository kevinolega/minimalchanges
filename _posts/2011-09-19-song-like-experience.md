Sometimes I experience better results when I don't obsess over the results.

Some may call this trusting God but that doesn't seem to be a bad idea.

Disappointment comes from expectations not meeting expectations.

Yes the numbers tell the whole story and the results don't lie.

How do you process when reality does not match what you want?

Do you blame, justify or complain?

Would it make better sense to look for blessing or areas of improvement?

What do you have?

What can you do?

In the song <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/higher-lyrics-creed.html">Higher</a>, Scott Stapp said the only difference between the land of dreams and our harsh reality is that we let our love replace all of our hate.

Will you sink so low or will you take the high road?

I don't know about you but up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time. This high I feel strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine.

Do you feel like I just copied from the song?

What song are you copying?
