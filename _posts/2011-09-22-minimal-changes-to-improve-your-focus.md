Our thoughts influence our results. Our results can be a direct reflection of our thoughts. The people I encountered who are at the top of their fields are pretty organized with what they do. I'm guessing that they don't have a mountain of things to worry about when they work. The ones I met have neat piles of things to do and they can go through them with pull power and have time to spare.

I used to be pretty disorganized. I have a mountain of things for pretty much anything in my life. I later realized that when we have too much everywhere our light is scattered. If you already figured out what you want to do and what's important to you shine your light there.

It's not the person with the best resources who succeeds. It's the person who uses what's available best that carries the day.

Here are some suggestions to improve your focus:
<ul>
	<li>Eliminate the things that have no real value to you. - I practice this all the time especially when I feel stuck.</li>
	<li>Cut what's left in half - a great small thing is always a lot better than a lousy big thing.</li>
	<li>Organize in to short lists - when you have a really short list you won't really have to.</li>
	<li>Do stuff - just start with the smallest thing you can do now.</li>
	<li>Rest and relax and celebrate - you finally got something done.</li>
	<li>Repeat - it's that simple.</li>
</ul>
