This is my post.

My blog.

My website.

My home online.

When I write, I do so about me, my stories and my experience.

Sometimes my writing is downright awesome. Sometimes it's ultra-lame.

I extract the thought from my brain into paper then type the ones I feel like sharing here.

I'm always tempted to sugar-coat my stories and pretend that my life is more awesome than it already is.

You're too smart for that. You can sense BS long before it shows up in a line. I welcome crazy thoughts. I don't tolerate bullshi+. I know you do too. This is me and I am not sorry.
