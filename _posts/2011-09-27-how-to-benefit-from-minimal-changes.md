Pick up what's useful and discard what is useless.

The posts here are based on my experience, my experiments and my story. I don't expect anyone to follow every word and base their lives on what I do and I wouldn't want you to do that.

You have so much to contribute on your own.

I really believe that.

Be your self and create an online self that is based on who you are.

Sometimes I'm dead serious.

Key word: "Sometimes"

Sometimes means not all the time.

This is a blog, not a bible so learn to lighten up will ya :)
