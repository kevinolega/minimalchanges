Standard, Average, Normal, Regular are words we use to describe the amount we use or get as default. It doesn’t mean that the usual/common is the right one for you or the right amount to make you happy. In the end you decide the right size.

Your goal or whatever can be as big or as small as you want as long as you don’t do it to impress others. In the end only you know what’s good for you. Some people may want huge, normal an small and the amount that you want is not limited to those three sizes. It’s your job to decide and be specific about how much you want.

I started thinking about this when I’m thinking about a formula for contentment. I don’t have a really solid answer but this is what I came up with so far.

Looking back at my experience going for some other person’s standards lead me only to unnecessary depression and frustration.

I like doing things on my own by my own schedule. There’s freedom in that and I really enjoy that freedom. An internal push causes the most productivity and creativity. There doesn't seem to be a way to force that that (believe me I tried doing that a lot).

The good news is doing things more often lets you do things better. So just go on with your life head toward what you want and go with what comes naturally if it helps you. If you dont like the results fix things as you go.

Can't be that hard to do right?
