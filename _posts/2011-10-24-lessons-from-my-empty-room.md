My room only contains a few things. 
My bed
An electric fan
Two pillows

I occasionally bring in the laptop but I bring it out when I'm about to sleep already. Being a minimalist had me thinking about how to effortlessly keep things clear, clean and have lots of free space. I finally got what I want. 

A downside of being a minimalist is sort of being claustrophobic and a bit of obsessive compulsive when it comes to cleaning up. I don't have the mental stamina for long cleaning sessions so I try to keep things as clean as I can as soon as I can. 

I realize that in life we always have backlog as a result of things that we procrastinate. We only have limited time and I'm not too confident that we can always get things done. 
So as a result things pile up. I get things done and I let things go to free myself up to process what's next. If things get too heavy, I let go some more. 

I get things done and I let things go. This approach to having less made things lighter and freer for me. What is your experience?
