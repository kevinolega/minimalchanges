<blockquote>Two words that make tech savvy people like me unproductive: software tester.

It's cool to have many abilities. The idea of being able to do a lot of things really get me excited. I've had that attitude with skills and tools. I collect skills, tools and apps that could help me.

It's a total waste of time. While it feels cool to have a whole bunch of them, I later realized that the extras have hindered me from working on the few important things I needed to do.

When I got my iOS device, I spent two weeks just downloading and testing apps. Last year I did the same with social networks. I had a few <a href="http://minimalchanges.com/life-after-facebook/">social network profiles I update regularly</a> and spent a lot of time networking and promoting yet I still haven't written down everything I wanted to say on my sites.

What if you had no more than five apps or tool that you do use and we ignored everything else?

iOS apps:
Simplenote
Wordpress
Twitter
iDone This
Reminders

What I bring with me every day:
iPod touch
Phone
Money clip with cash
Nothing else

What I should be doing everyday:
Wake up early
Write one or two posts
Get the top two tasks of my day job done before lunch
Publish
Get some rest

There's not much else. I'm pretty sure you have an idea of what needs to be done. Are you building a top ten list or are you working on your top two?
