<blockquote>Most people underestimate themselves an overestimate the competition.

When people see my profile I get two reactions. My more successful friends tell me that I can do better and my other friends tell me no effin way.

Last month I turned twenty six and every time I'm at parties or meeting someone new for the first time. People usually say wow you're already an account manager, worked as a consultant (I did work as sales consultant and I have enough info and experience in the product lines I handled), been to sales and marketing, run a few websites, etc or they don't believe me because if my age.

Here's how I do it.

I don't advocate lying and downplaying yourself is worse than exaggerating what you can do. Do your best to communicate what you have well.

It's not what you say but how you say it.

A few months ago my friend asked me to help him write a resume because his contract ended where he work. Since I was feeling generous, I helped him out for free and at the same time used the experience to add to my goal of writing for 10,000 hours.

My friend had the position of data encoder for a local church. When I asked him about the ten things that he did in the past few months at work, he told me that he was:
-in charge of the office supplies
-in charge of maintaining an updating the database
-in charge of editing and printing ID's, forms, handouts and other office related print materials.
-a regular volunteer who assists in organizing their church events.
- the go to person for quick and free design
-the technical support person

Is that your typical data encoder?

He also told me that he was in charge mostly because he is the one who knows and is available for the tasks. I'm going to go out on a limb to say that he's probably not and if it were me I'd put data and admin officer or something like that.

In fact that's what I put. He agreed, said thanks, applied and got hired to do a higher level of what he did.

I admit it. Whenever I try something new I wing it most of the time. My information will never be complete so I give whateverit is that I'd like to try and gain experience from the results.

I put my best face forward and I attempt to grow into the kind of person I want to become. Sometimes I'm successful and sometimes I am not.

Good or bad there's always a take away. I apply the lessons for my next attempts and get better with minimal changes. Heck,that's what this site is about.

I simply put out my best work out there, let people try it and I try to improve it as I go.

Nothing's perfect.

I have my wins and losses.

Here are some thoughts on how I write my profile:

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iPmVHRIq4EQ/Tr9oJiHx8sI/AAAAAAAAGNw/1h_getRtCXY/s640/Learn%252520form%252520Success.png" alt="" />
1. Unless you're just giving away free cash, you're probably hiring me for things I can do so I'm putting all my wins related to the job I'm applying for on my profile. That's all my cards I think you'll be interested in on the table.

2. I talk about my losses and experiences in detail upon request. Employers are interested in what I can do and not what I can't do but if a job involves doing something I'm unable to do, I'm usually the first to volunteer that information.

I remember being processed for a job for a major tech company (think almost every PC on the planet) for a tech evangelist position and they said that my sales and marketing skills are up to par with what they are looking for and they told me that they're lookin for someone with above average programming skills, and I told them that the only programming I did was from the sites and I had some help and I use easy to use tools for it. That automatically disqualified me for the job but my interviewer promised me they she'll find me a position that would match me as soon a it opens. Guess what? I keep getting calls from their local headhunter up to now.

3. Most small companies ask their employees to do more than their job description. I would hear them say I'm an office staff and I interview applicant and I research suppliers and I double check payroll and I maintain a lot of the office PC's. Don't fret you're an admin officer that does, recruitment, payroll and tech support, rolled into one person.

My experience? I volunteered to do certain things our of my job description and I added them to my resume. I have limited experience working on different tasks usually handled by an operations manager, I put assisted in office operations. You get the picture. Clearest, nicest without exaggeration. I also have a habit of asking for better sounding titles whenever I can.

4. Your own business card, website, online profile, resume or portfolio helps. Many people say its not important bit it has helped with my experience. I invested a bit in my own and I have to say that it has helped me a lot.

5. People say first impressions last so I should <a href="http://minimalchanges.com/be-brave-put-your-best-foot-forward/">put my best foot forward</a>. I totally agree. Here's one way we can both add value to that saying, both your best foot and bad side are your feet. You can train your other site to be identical to your best foot.t I'm trying to get at I'd that you have the opportunity to grow into your best foot eventually. Do so as soon as you can.

Check out my profile on <a href="http://kevinolega.com">kevinolega.com</a> for how I implemented this.

How do you brand to get work?
