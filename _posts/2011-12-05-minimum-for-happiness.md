What's the minimum amount you have to own to be happy?

The good news is that after a year I realized that I already own most of the things that I want. I'm not forcing myself to be content. I really am. Sometimes I doubt myself because of the marketing but I really am. I'm happy with what I have and in fact I'm trying to have even less because in my experience it's less stressfull because less is manageable. It's fun making the most out of a few things. I want to be able to live out of a bag. I'm about 90% there. What happens next? I wouldn't know but I promise to tell you when I get there.

It's almost Christmas. This is my list. What's yours?
