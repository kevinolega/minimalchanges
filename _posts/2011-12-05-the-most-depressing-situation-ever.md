<em>my not giving up face</em>

We've all had what we thought was the most depressing situation ever. When nasty things happen and you lose all hope and you're thinking it'd be better to destroy yourself.

It's game over. My life's over. The world's over.

The truth is its not. The good thing about game over is that your character dies and has an option to start over. It can be the same game or a different one.

And besides you can take a long walk, a cold shower or write down your thoughts to clear your head.

I'm thinking that you probobly pray.

If that's the case you don't need to worry.

God has your back and I'll try to be here to be available for you.

During Bible study I saw this verse which I don't recall ever encountering before.

Ecclesiastes 7:10 Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?”
For it is not wise to ask such questions.

Interesting enough in the same chapter:

Ecclesiastes 7:8a The end of a matter is better than its beginning

Is your most depressing situation ever really your most depressing situation ever?
