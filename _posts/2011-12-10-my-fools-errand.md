Would you like to see more of me everyday?

I've been thinking about how I can add value and although I consider myself to be a pretty well rounded person, I'm going to go ahead and follow my gut and do specific topics on different blogs. 

First, my blog <a href="http://philippineislandliving.com">Philippine Island Living</a> is about opportunities and tips about living in the Philippines.  I'll also share my broke travel adventures there. 

I'm building an online resource about call center application tips for Filipinos. You can check out <a href="http://pcct.kevinolega.com">the Call Center Application Tips here. </a>

I'm not definite about my plans yet on all the blogs. That's the beauty of it. There's too many instances that my world is telling me to throw my faith down the drain and make hard choices because what I'm doing is a fool's errand. 

I think I'd rather stay a fool for now and show up regularly to create guides and inspiration by using what I have and doing what I can. 

What's on your mind recently?
