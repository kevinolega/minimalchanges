<blockquote>I had no idea my book giveaway winners would be this sweet</blockquote>
If you're following me on <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinolega">twitter</a> you might have noticed that<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kevinolega/status/146253320284147712"> I'm giving away my book collection for free.</a>

So far I've given away three books.

The whole giveaway promo thing was something I learned from a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jurinsthea">fashion blogger I recently met</a>. The idea was to get them to retweet something that pointed people to read my sure or to <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinolega">follow me on twitter</a>. I then, forgot that I need to be specific about the mechanics. I then tweeted, first one to retweet this gets a free book. It eventually went to a whole bunch of people I recently became friends with.

The first book: Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk went to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Carameladayrit">@carameladayrit</a>. Melai Dayrit. Maker of the best banana cakes on the planet. I'll write about it in a bit at my other website, <a href="http://philippineislandliving.com">Philippine Island Living</a> later.

The second book: The Vampire Chronicles' Book Seven: Blood an Gold
Which follows the story of Marius to <a href="http://sheenahtan.net">Sheenah Tan</a> the top online reputation manager in the Philippines. Not only that she's also one of the prettiest and most multi talented person I recently met.

The third book: V for Vendetta. Is a novel (not the graphic novel) of the film V for Vendetta. The book will go to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/oddtart">@oddtarts</a> a talented artist and a new friend.

The fourth book, anger at work is going to Sheenah Tan, again.

I'm still deciding on what book to give away next but there will be more.

I initially started the site or any activity for the matter to promote my work self blog etc. now I found something a whole lot better since I started the contest.

My new ex-boss told me recently, if I keep focusing on my goals and what I want later in life, I'll end up missing out on a billion things I could be enjoying right now.

So I'm ditching the marketing and just doing what I want. Should you want to try it out for yourself, here are some of the benefits I gained:
<ul>
	<li>**Clearing up mental space**. - I think about each of the items I own consciously or unconsciously. I'm sure you do too. Where is it? Did I lose it? Where an I going to put it. Is it safe where it is. More importantly, when do I clean it up or put it away. And I'm thinking about items we can do without.</li>
	<li> **Clearing up physical space**. - you get the idea. I have to put it somewhere, the question is, where? I also have to put it away after use or clean it up or maintenance. Can I bring it when I travel? How troublesome.</li>
	<li> **Sharing my blessings -** I use my items a lot and bring them almost anywhere, until I'm done with them. I hope you enjoy them too.</li>
	<li> **Making new friends** - I'm making friends as I give stuff away either bond with a new one or catch up with an old one and in the end we both get what we want.</li>
</ul>
I have too much stuff. No matter how I sometimes feel like I do not have enough. It's the greed and marketing talking. Giving is the cure for greed. It worked for me. That it's self is benefit enough on top of the ones I shared.

Do you have a giveaway plan?
