None of the links of the accomplishments are intended to brag. I only want to show you that its possible for you too. At the start of last year I was only wishing about these things. If you noticed some of the post a lot of them is me talking to myself wishing to have the changes now. I have a lot of them now.

<a href="http://inoveryourhead.net/">Julien Smith</a> said in “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Flinch-ebook/dp/B0062Q7S3S">The Flinch</a>” We all change slowly. Rest assured we do change. I was feeling crappy a few days ago and when I started to make a list of how things changed, how my situation have changed and how I have changed, I realized that I got everything I wanted from last year and more.

2012 should be a year of contentment for me as I take on new challenges and learn new things. Whether you set goals or not, I believe that whatever it is that you’re working on, you’ll get what you want and more too. Pray. Trust God. Enjoy what’s in front of you. Use what you have. Do what you can.

If for any reason I was unable to explain properly how I did it. Hit me up on twitter or email me and I'll do my best to share how I did it.

How was your year? And what are you hoping for for next year?
