Sometimes we don't like our situation. Looking back this bad experience contributes to what we call blessings.

Guess what? If you just relax and see where these things take you, you'd be surprised at the amount of unseen blessings you're actually receiving. Take time to be thankful because if you know that 90% of blessings are invisible, then it's no use getting worked up over situations that you don't like.
