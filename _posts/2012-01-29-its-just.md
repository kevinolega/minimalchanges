Money. 
A job. 
Work. 
A car. 
A girlfriend. 
Possession. 
Whatever it is. 

I don't mean in any way that these things aren't valuable. When I realized exactly what these things are the obsession to sacrifice everything to pursue them slowly disappeared. I'm not an enlightened monk. Nor am I trying to pretend to be one on the Internet but if for some reason you also get see things as just what it is there might be less drama when things go wrong or less fear of loss when we to encounter them. 

What's your opinion?
