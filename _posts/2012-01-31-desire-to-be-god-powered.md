I encountered this Message a year ago. It eventually became a place I wanted to be. In my experience this was not where I was all the time. 

I've been waiting for quite a while now and it seems that today, God is answering my prayers. 

No I will not get a reduction in my daily challenges but at this point I feel my backup has arrived. It's too early to tell so I better keep my mouth shut as I watch things unfold. 

Stay tuned for the stories.
