There are only a few things within our control and may things are out of our control. I'm glad I'm not in charge of everything because honestly, I don't believe I would be able to manage that much. Imagine being in charge of the water cycle or my own digestive system or the end to end process of everything else. That would be too troublesome and I don't think I'm qualified or competent for all that an I'm glad the One who is has it in His hands so I have no right to complain or worry. When you are in an environment filled with distrust I guarantee it would be very stressful. Trust opens up opportunities of freedom an a relaxed life for me. Guess Who I'm trusting?
