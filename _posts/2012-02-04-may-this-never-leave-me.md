The first verse that spoke to me was from verse 11 which says "they say God has forsaken him, pursue him and seize him for no one will rescue him. "

I definitely felt that way. Then I realized that many times the reality is far from what it looks or how it feels. 

How many times have you hoped for something and people said you were crazy? How many times have you been in a situation where what you hoped for happened anyway?

When miracles happen in our life it is God that moves. Sometimes He makes us move with Him. Let's not forget where miracles come from and that although many miracles manifest in us and through us it is God that controls all things. 

What are you hoping for?
