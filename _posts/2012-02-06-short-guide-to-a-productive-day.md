A while back I wrote a short guide to keep myself productive. Nothing here is original. Everything is advice I read or received that I was tried to apply and had gotten results so without further adieu, enjoy:

Try to focus so you can be more productive.

Start your day right from the night before.

Sleep early.

Wake up early.

Have Breakfast.

Read.

Write.

Finish One Important thing today.

Finish another one.

Donâ€™t Check your email yet.

Finish a couple more.

And now you you feel like you can do anything.

Blast away. 

Rest. 

Repeat.
