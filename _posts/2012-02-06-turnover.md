As one chapter ends, we end up facing another one. Every lesson we learned from the past will be used for our next challenges. Old allies part ways and some stay together. Talking like Optimus Prime won't bring out what I wanted to say so I'll stop right here. 

Faith is a big part of what we do. If we don't have faith, everything goes to hell.  Facing challenges bigger than what we previously faced can make us think we'll be driven crazy but it won't. Sometimes fire and flood sweep over us but in the end we are somehow victorious. I have no idea why but I know I that support always arrives in ways I don't expect so I'm sometimes careless as I face challenges. I blog here to encourage myself and you if any of these inspires you. 

I'd love to hear from you so feel free to contact me.
