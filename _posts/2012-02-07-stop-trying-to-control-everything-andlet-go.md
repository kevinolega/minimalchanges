One of the last I read an article together from Leo of Zen Habits is about <a href="http://zenhabits.net/control/">ditching goals and expectation</a>. Applying the lessons from the post made me pretty flexible and adaptive to most things. Reading the Bible also pointed against being anxious, impatient or believing in a fixed future. 

Applying it to myself, I can say that I can do it to most things. For really important things like waiting for relationships to get patched up, I'm often stressed or depressed at the very thought of it. I know that God is in control and the best situations for our preparation will always have a match. My question is when. I'm both scared and excited about what's to come. 

Today I got another reminder that it's not up to me. The Bible has been talking back more often these days. 

As nervous as I am right now, I'll have to chill an enjoy the ride. 

What do you feel the need to let go of?
