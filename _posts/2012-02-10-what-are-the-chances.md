I continued reading shortly after selecting the first one. What are the chances that my situation can be found where I'm currently reading? I don't have an answer but I trust all will be well. Things change slowly but they do change. We won't notice it by the day but given enough time we always see results. The passage ended with You have taken my companions and loved ones from me and darkness is my closest friend. I do feel that too but I know that although hope is hidden it is there. God does not leave me. When I don't see Him move somehow I know that He is standing at my blind spot. I'm waiting for Him to make a move. My restlessness and impatience within me is on a rampage. I struggle to be still and wait. There's a reason why this episode is important to the plot of our series and we'll both find soon enough.
