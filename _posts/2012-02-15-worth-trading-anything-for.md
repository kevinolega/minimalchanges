In the past few days, I felt that I traded a lot of things to follow God. I realized what I was getting in return and I realized more things that I keep getting that I don't see. This message reminds me to be thankful and to be patient that whatever I else I want will come to me without me having to strive for it. Everything I lost will be restored but it will surely be a surprise for me so it probably also won't arrive the way I expect it. 

What's worth trading anything for?
