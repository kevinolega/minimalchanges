Sometimes I believe that I deserve more. The reality is that we deserve more bad things for what we do. No matter how bad the situation is, it seems as if the worst is always held back. I also get a lot of good things that I don't deserve. Most of it is something I didn't really work for. I'm learning the concept of grace and as I look around I see how much I have of it in my life and I also feel wanting to give it to others. 

From something as simple as keeping my cool when someone makes a mistake or to letting people off from what they owe me. 

What comes to mind when you ponder about what you deserve? How do you reciprocate?
