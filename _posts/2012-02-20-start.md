<h2>Welcome to Minimal Changes.</h2>
This is a collection of my writings since I started working on myself in 2010. You can read from my latest post on the right sidebar or visit <a href="http://minimalchanges.com">the archives</a> to see everything.

If you're new here and you're wondering where to start. Here are a few posts that I recommend. I hope you have as much fun reading them as I've had writing them. I wrote these posts to keep myself inspired and to make the advice I give myself to friends.

Since I enjoyed writing so much I decided to continue after my experiments in minimalism and go after getting rid of debt and to start saving. I also went to take control of my appetites and tried to live on less. I pared down my goals to just the essentials. I let go of even more things.

I'm currently retelling the stories on how I started and I'm releasing articles I didn't post.
