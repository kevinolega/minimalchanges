When I was younger, I pretended to be fearless. As I was growing up old fears are replaced by new fear. I'm now learning about a fear that enables me to be almost fearless or at the very least, not worry about my worst fears. 

I recently encountered my worst fears and the reality is that it isn't as bad as it sounded as I was imagining it. I'd like this to be the only fear I have.

Who knows, maybe several years from now we can go back to this post and be amazed that it happened. 

Let's stay in touch. Till next time.
