<blockquote>Daily meeting notes</blockquote>
If you’ve been reading my blog for a while you probably are seeing Bible Messages with comments. I’ve been reading a lot recently and I figured that since I’m writing for myself and that my audience are people who are like me and I’ve been pretty inspired with what I was reading maybe it would inspire you too.

I do recommend that you get your own Bible and read it on your own as well. The experience is even better. If you’re interested in that, here’s the story of how I got started:

During my last few training months with Carlo, he taught me how to read the Bible. We didn’t start with the Bible exactly. We started with the book <a href="http://www.asamanthinketh.net/">”As A Man Thinketh”</a> which was based on one of the Psalms from the Bible. The instruction was, to go through just one chapter every week and pick the verse that “speaks to me or about my situation” and I’m only allowed to pick one. After, selecting one verse, I’m supposed to write it down, memorize it and ponder why I find it relevant or why I could relate to it and how it can help with my situation. After a few days Carlo suggested that it’s also the same method he does when he reads the Bible and in his experience it’s good practice.

A couple of months ago, I started getting bored and didn’t read regularly. It’s as if I couldn’t digest the message even if what I was reading was making sense. That’s when I remembered writing it down only this time I decided to make the experience more fun and personal.

I get to enjoy creating art from my daily messages by <a href="http://minimalchanges.com/how-to-increase-your-confidence-by-writing-big/">writing it down with big fonts</a>, using it as a wallpaper, using Instagram to modify the picture
and sharing it here to keep myself accountable to reading everyday.

Since I use minimal changes as a place of inspiration, I figure I'd post it here too for personal use. If you're interested you could check it out in the previous posts. If not, then you could just skip to the next post.

Would you be willing to tell me about your experience?
