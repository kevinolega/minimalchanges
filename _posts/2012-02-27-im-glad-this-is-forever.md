Not a lot of things last forever. Everything on this planet is temporary. I'm glad God's love will last forever. Whatever my situation is, it won't last. Whatever God promised, He is always faithful to accomplish. It makes me think about my teamwork with God. I imagine what it would be like but for now, we need to guard and tame my heart first. With the amount of encouragement I'm receiving now, I don't have an excuse not to move forward but that's for another story.
