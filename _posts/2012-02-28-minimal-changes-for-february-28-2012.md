Dear All,

I realize that I’m going off topic with my recent posts in the last month and I feel that I have to stop. I created a tumblog to place links, pictures, quotes, stories, rants and my favorite daily bible messages.

Starting today you’ll see only original writing on <a href="http://minimalchanges.com">minimal changes</a>.

I hope this move will let you enjoy my site better.

If you’d still like to read my daily bible messages, <a href="http://kevinolega.tumblr.com">head on over to my tumblog</a>.

Thank you,

Kevin

P.S. I'll still write every day. Well maybe not on Sundays but we'll see. Thanks for reading my blog.
