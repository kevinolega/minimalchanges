For the month of March... 

There will be no pictures for posts on minimal changes. 

I'm also ditching my usual notebook and writing exclusively on notecards,  scrivener, and the built in note app of the iPod touch. 

I'll tell you later how this turns out. 

What are you experimenting on for March?
