We are a generation sharing cleaver or cute things we see online. There's facebook shares, retweets, 9gag, pinterest and a whole bunch of other things shared every day.

I wonder what it would be like to see a blog done by my mom or dad that's full of tips and advice as I face life's challenges.

Imagine your future kid or kids receiving that message from you in case life gets in the way and be able to say whatever you really meant to.

Imagine more people showing the world what they can do. I wish, I could stop imagining and start seeing. 

I won't pretend that I can imagine how awesome your creations can get.

I hope to see what you can do soon. 

Go ahead and create, know that I'm excited to see it. 

Art is not beautiful because it passes a standard or it impresses critics. Art is beautiful because you created it.

I sincerely believe that.
