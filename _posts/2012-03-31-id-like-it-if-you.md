Work on yourself starting from <a href="http:minimalchanges.com">minimal changes</a>. 
Use my ideas and profit from it. 
Learn something that helped you cope with a personal crisis. 
<a href="http://minimalchanges.com/archives">Find something that inspires you</a> during a bad day. <a href="http://minimalchanges.com/you-are-royalty-act-like-it/"> Get reminded of your value</a> because I believe in you. 
Smile. 
Buy a product or service I recommend that you could use. 
Like this or share this in your social network. 
Email this or print this out and give it to a friend. 
Email me how my writing had contributed you. 

I won't like it if you...
Think you won't succeed or be happy if you don't follow my advice. 
Copy exactly how I live my life. 
Idolize me. 
Be stressed because you haven't been able to copy my advice to the letter. 

The advice is just here no rush to change. I know you can eventually. Keep going. Buy me a drink after a few wins.
