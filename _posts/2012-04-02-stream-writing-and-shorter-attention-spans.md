When I committed to writing regularly <a href="http://kevinolega.com">here on Google+</a> I realized that I now have an opportunity to meet needs better than I did in my blogs.

Thanks to how we now consume information on the Internet, people today have shorter attention spans. Doing more is now counterproductive because we are all avoiding information overload. In the past I tried to write a comprehensive guide to what I want to teach.

Now I'm changing because it's not too sustainable. My only challenge now is having a list of my posts like an archive that's easy to navigate but I'll worry about that later.

For the month of April I'll write exclusively from my Google+ stream. I'd like to find out if my writing is more beneficial here than on my blogs.

I would appreciate feedback and feel free to send requests either through email or on the comments.
