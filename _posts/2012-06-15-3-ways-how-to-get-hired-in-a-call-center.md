When people ask me what is the best method of applying in a call center, I always tell them to go through a walk-in application.
<strong>Walk-in applications</strong> -  can shave away a few steps from the recruitment process. You don’t have to send your resume online. The recruiter does not have to paper screen your resume, call you, do a phone interview or phone screen you and schedule you for an interview. They don’t have to think about will this applicant show up or not.

You’re there so they’ll prioritize you.

Most call centers have a one day processes and sometimes half day processes. So you’ll get your answer if you passed or failed within the day. That’s a good thing. You don’t spend a few days waiting for the answer. You can grab an opportunity immediately or move on to the next one if you need to.

<strong>Online applications</strong> - This is my second source of interviews. I don’t do this a lot for call centers but when I was applying for a corporate sales position, I did see a lot of openings on Jobstreet and Jobsdb. I’m sure you’ll land one immediately the advantage of an online application is you don’t have to leave your house to find an interview. The downside is that it sometimes takes a while to get a call. My solution is to send out as many online applications as I can and you should too. It's a bit like a raffle. The more entries, the more chances of winning.
<strong>Referrals</strong> - Several call center companies are ramping up on a regular basis. That means they are hiring a lot of people. In those cases they ask agents to refer their friends. Sometimes for free and sometimes for a fee. If you have a friend who works for a call center you can ask for openings and they’ll be happy to refer you. You can ask for some inside information but I don’t normally rely on that.

I’d rather be in control of the situation than wait for my friend’s referral. This doesn’t mean I don’t accept referrals, what I mean is that referrals are acceptable when applying for work but my main activity is me applying.

<strong>Update. Some call centers pay a referral fee to the person and will pay you a referral fee if you pass training and get regularized. That's a win win situation for you right there. Where I work it's Php 7,000 for the applicant and the referrer. If you would like to apply where I work send me a message and tell me that you want to apply where I work. I'll do my best to assist you.</strong>

These are the ones that have worked for me and for other people that I’ve obeserved that got hired in a call center.

Do you have a preferred job application method? Send me a message and share your experience.
