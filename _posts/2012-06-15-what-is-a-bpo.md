BPO stands for business process outsourcing. Outsourcing is asking someone to do something for you and paying them for it. You outsource something because:</strong></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>it’s cheaper (cost-effective)</li>
	<li>they can do better than you (quality)</li>
	<li>you don’t have the time to do it yourself (convenience)</li>
</ul>
<strong>We outsource tasks regularly.<strong>

<ul>
	<li>laundry shops are places where we outsource our laundry</li>
	<li>fast foods and restaurants are where we outsource our food preparation</li>
	<li>public transportation is where we outsource our transportation needs.</li>
</ul>
Business process outsourcing is the same as outsourcing our tasks, except they’re outsourcing business processes. Almost any business process can be outsourced.

<strong>Here are common outsourced business processes in a call center.<strong>
<ul>
	<li>Customer Service</li>
	<li>Technical Support</li>
	<li>Sales</li>
</ul>
These are the top three. A lot of Call Center Jobs are in these three fields. There are more but you’ll find out about that later.

Was I able to explain this part clearly? Send me a message.
