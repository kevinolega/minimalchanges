<h2>What the heck is a Call Center?</h2>
<blockquote>Wikipedia says:<strong><strong>
</strong></strong>A call centre or call center is a centralised office used for the purpose of receiving and transmitting a large volume of requests by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone">telephone</a>. A call centre is operated by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company">company</a> to administer incoming product support or information inquiries from consumers. Outgoing calls for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemarketing">telemarketing</a>, clientele, product services, and debt collection are also made.</blockquote>
That’s true.
The real question is:
<h2>What the heck is a call center for me?</h2>
<strong><strong>For different people there are different answers.
</strong></strong>
<ul>
	<li>For a business owners it’s a place to outsource business related tasks we’d rather not handle on our own.</li>
	<li>For some entrepreneurs it’s a business opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<strong><strong>But that’s not who I wrote this blog for.
</strong></strong>
<ul>
	<li>You just retired from your work voluntarily or involuntarily and you’re bored with staying at home and looking for a source of income a call center maybe for you.</li>
	<li>You’re a fresh graduate, looking to earn some money for yourself or to start a business later on.</li>
	<li>You’re a new graduate and you can’t find a job in the field of study you took up in college.</li>
	<li>You’re a single mom looking for a way to make ends meet.</li>
	<li>You have someone you can’t support, who needs a job.</li>
	<li>You want to learn business practices and how some foreign companies operate.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The call center is in no way the prefect solution. I myself am not currently employed in one. The pay is pretty okay and the shifts vary and you may like it or not like it depending on your lifestyle.
I present it as a stepping stone to other opportunities like:
</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Funding your going back to school budget.</li>
	<li>Funding your own business.</li>
	<li>Funding your migrate to abroad plan “I hope not!”</li>
	<li>Paying for expenses and a source of income while you figure things out.</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
Whatever it is it’s not limited to that. Use your imagination friend. That will be all for now from me.
