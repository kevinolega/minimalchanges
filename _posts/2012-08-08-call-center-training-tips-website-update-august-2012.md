Hi There,

If you've been coming back often you probably noticed a few changes in Call Center Training Tips.

The goal of <a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com">Call Center Training Tips</a> is to provide assistance for people who want to work in a call center.

If you have friends who want to get hired in a call center but would need a little help with their confidence or English skills then this I prepared this for them.

I've been hard at work to accommodate a few requests to make it easy for you to share the lessons with your friends.

<h2>Here are the changes I've done so far:</h2>

<h3>First:</h3>

I created a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Call-Center-Training-Tips/449507911746386">facebook page</a>. Updates on this site will show up on your facebook page if you like or subscribe to it. You can also
share the posts there so your friends can see.

<h3>Second</h3>

If you're also on twitter, I also opened<a href="http://twitter.com/calltipsph"> a twitter account</a> for you.

<h3>Third</h3>

If you have friends who would like to have someone to personally help them in their job hunt, I put out a services page. I could help out with their resume or with their confidence or interview skills. <a title="Services" href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/services/">More details here</a>.

<h3>Fourth</h3>

I made it easier to reach me by adding contact forms on the <a title="Contact" href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/contact/">contact</a> or <a title="Services" href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/services/">services</a> page.

If you benefited or enjoyed the lessons please feel free to share with your friends or send me a message or leave a comment.

Thank you very much,

Kevin Olega
webmaster of Call Center Training Tips
