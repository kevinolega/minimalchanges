Last night, I had a facebook chat session with a friend. He told me he’s been having bad luck with looking for work. I realized that I get this a lot from unemployed friends and friends of friends so I decided to write tips on how to overcome bad luck in getting hired.

Different version include:

<blockquote>I haven’t been hired so it looks like a call center job is not for me.

It looks like I’m not good enough to get hired.

I’m convinced I’m not qualified to work there.

Malas lang. Gusto ko pero ayaw sakin.

Looks like I’ll have to get back to [insert low paying job]</blockquote>

When that happens I ask them about their experience. I’ve been asking questions about this since 2007 by  now I figured out the three most important questions to ask.

<strong>I think this is useful if you’re a spouse or a parent who has a loved one who’s down because he or she couldn’t find work. </strong>

<strong>This also works if you’re that loved one.</strong>

<h2 dir="ltr">Question 1: How many interviews have you had?</h2>

<strong>Less than 15:</strong> Please spend more time looking for work.

In my experience it takes people an average of 1-3 rejections before giving up. Others take 4-5 rejections but no more than that.

Grow some balls, take that rejection and use it to be better.

<strong>More than 15:</strong> I think you’re unlucky. Naaah I’m just kidding. Have you done all that you can do to improve yourself? Maybe you haven’t. Leave a comment in the blog or send me a message and I’ll see what I can do to help you.

Chances are there are only one or two mistakes that you’re doing that messes up your job application and if we figure that out then you’re good to go.

<h2 dir="ltr">Question 2: How many call centers have you walked in to?</h2>

<strong>Less than 20:</strong> Come on friend you can do better than that. Work on finding work. Seriously. Don’t be a modern Juan Tamad. Walk in submit your resume to the nearest call center.

<strong>More than 20:</strong> Congratulations friend you’re getting the hang of it. Maybe there’s something you can work on. Ask yourself.

What problems do you have with your interview?

<h2 dir="ltr">Question 3: How many online job applications have you sent?</h2>

<strong>Less than 50:</strong> Please send more copies of your resume and job applications to more companies. Applications tend get lost in the mail (spam folder) or get ignored because of obvious reasons so on and so forth but It’s okay. Before you get quality you need to go through the quantity. Send applications in large numbers.

<strong>More than 50:</strong> That’s great. Before I ask you to repeat this process. I’d like you to check out my <a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/how-to-write-a-resume-for-call-center-application/">call center resume writing tips</a>.

If you’re not getting the results you want I suggest you walk in and apply in person. What have you got to lose? If you ask your interviewer for some tips and why you got rejected you now know what to work on.

<h2>Here’s a true story about me:</h2>

When I look for work I send out 200-300 online job applications to different companies. Sometimes I don’t read the full job description. I skim through it and look for the words female only (and obviously don’t apply there).
I print 30 copies of my resume and keep going until I have to print another batch (30 copies).
It then, takes an average of 16-20 interviews before I get hired.

Yes I also get rejected but I don’t take that as a personal rejection. Its just that I’m not qualified for this specific interviewer and there are more opportunities in the world no need to be emo or suicidal.

Sometimes this company’s culture doesn’t fit my standards (or doesn’t pay high enough) so I’m not taking their offer.

So remember.

Some will, some won’t, so what? Someone is waiting for you so shut up and move on to the next one.

I can’t emphasize that enough.

Two things to remember.

The numbers tell the whole story.

The harder you work, the luckier you get.
