My strength’s change from time to time because I am always learning. I found out that today’s strengths are often last year’s weakness.

If I wake up early, save money, eat less, explain well or write regularly today, I was doing the exact opposite last year.

I regularly write a list of my strengths on paper. If you do the same, you’ll see clearly what you have to offer. I recommend writing your top ten accomplishments and/or things you’re proud of and pick a strength from that situation.

I enjoy talking about new strengths because I can tell a story about how it was previously a weakness and how I overcome it.

In a call center interview, when asked, what are your strengths? I recommend answering in terms of what’s related to the job you’re applying for. When you answer this question do not recite a list, share some information on why and how it became your strength. (There isn’t really a right answer to this question. The interviewer is checking your conversational skills and also watching for grammar and pronunciation mistakes.)

<h3>Here are some call center application related answers I used for what my strengths:</h3>

When I was younger, I enjoyed talking on the phone. The longest time I stayed on the phone was for 26 hours and I was on the phone with my high school best friend and my high school crush and it was on New Year’s day.

I often wake up really late because I stayed up all night, I figured I’d do really well in this job because the schedule matches my lifestyle and I would have no problems adjusting to working at night. (Plus I'll get to sleep all day and party all night on my off days without feeling guilty)

For as far as I can remember, I’m the only person people went to if they need help with their computer. If they need an explanation on how things worked or to get their computer fixed without going to a computer repair shop and paying. I figure I’d be a good match for that work. (If you're applying for tech support)

I learn a lot talking to different kinds of people. I really enjoy talking to people from other countries. I figure, there’s a lot of opportunity for that for me here since I’ll be taking calls from abroad here. (Don't say you want to be exposed to customers or expose yourself to customers)

I heard the pay is really good for starters and I don’t mind working nights and I have experience in my previous jobs doing (customer service or sales or tech support)

<h3>Very important</h3>

These are things I would suggest that you include in your answer and not the answers themselves. Answer questions as you normally would. Have a conversation with your interviewer and hint to them that you're a great match for the job.
