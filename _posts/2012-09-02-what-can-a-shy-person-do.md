You might have noticed me talking about shy people a lot on this blog. You can see it in the sidebar, my book, some of my post and now I'm writing a post focused for shy people.

I write to help shy people get hired in a call center. The goal of a lot of the things I do on different blogs is to empower the shy person. My heart goes out to shy people because I am a shy person.

<h3>You might not believe it but..</h3>

For the longest time I've been a really shy person. You can still see how sometimes I'm nervous when I'm with someone new or how I stutter when I talk.

Back in school, I was the guy who sits at the back of the class or on the sides with not much friends. I couldn't even get a girlfriend until my best friend introduces a girl over the phone (and I asked her to be my girlfriend over the phone and our relationship was mostly over the phone). Pathetic, right? I'm a shy person. When you introduce me to a girl I'll be mostly quiet and I'll hope to get the girl's number and text or call her. That's it.

<strong>Despite being good looking, I saw myself as inadequate or insignificant.</strong> I had issues with myself and trusting others and so on.

<h3>I never imagined myself...</h3>

Getting a job in sales and approaching strangers to offer products and services.
Getting hired in a call center
Working as a teacher and a tutor
Speaking in front of a crowd about how to get hired in a call center.
Sharing my thoughts on the public web regularly and people pay attention.

As of today I've done each one and I had no idea things would turn out like this. I was also helped by another shy person who I admired and I hope to just pay this forward.

If you're a shy person who would like to move forward with what you want in life or what you want to accomplish, just as I did, Here are some tips that I think you can use:

<strong>1. Keep your goals a secret.</strong> I recently learned that if you share your goals with others, you risk being acknowledged and as a result lose the willpower to make that goal a reality. So I decided to ditch telling people about my goals and just go after it. I even wrote a post about that on <a href="http://kevinolega.com/why-keep-goals-secret/">my personal blog</a>.

<strong>2. Go after what excites you.</strong> I'm excited by talking to interesting people so I got a job that allows me to. Early on I moved between call center work and sales.

<strong>3. Go after what scares you.</strong> I'm afraid of (insert fear) and I'd like to give it (my fear) a try. It turns out that that what scares me leads me to what excites me and vice versa. I learned from Tim Ferriss that fear is an excellent guide to where I need to go to achieve what I want. Not just the fact that the level of success I'll achieve in life is directly proportionate to how many uncomfortable conversations I'm willing to have. Doing what I fear increases my confidence. Try something that scares you.

<strong>4. Imagine what a better you looks like and grow into that. </strong>We know what a successful person looks like. Whether it's a call center agent or a parent or a lover. Let's take that further. List down the attributes of the kind of person you want to be. How does that person make decisions and be that person. Decide how he/she decides and act like how he/she acts. When you do this, you'll notice that the person you want to be and the person you are now is the same person except for some small changes like being consistent and trying out some stuff more. Go do that. Stuck?

<strong>5. Look at other people you admire and copy the traits that you like. </strong>If you have no idea where to go start with people you admire. I would give you a word of warning though. People we admire are good sources of direction on where to go but don't stay following and try to become exactly like them. You're awesome too. The world needs you and not just some copy of the person you admire. It took me years to get this.

<strong> 6. Experiment. </strong>Don't just go with what I say. In fact, you don't need me to tell you what to do. Try things yourself and prove to yourself what works and what doesn't work.

<strong>7. Go the opposite. </strong>If something doesn't work out in my life I go the opposite direction. If most people are quitting and slacking off I'll work on something. If everyone's competing for something I'll quit and go after something else. That's just me. This isn't an excuse to do the opposite of what doesn't work. I believe you're smart enough to figure this out.

<strong>8. Other people are scared too. </strong>According to <a href="http://sivers.org">Derek Sivers</a>, Nobody knows the future and nobody knows what they're doing. It's a wise quote and I'm trying to embed this in my heart right now so I know how to face people who intimidate me. Growing up as a shy person I'm scared to approach people, talk to them and ask for things. I thought some superior being who knows exactly what to say or do is before me and I'm insignificant. Other people feel the same way as well and we're all just pretending to be confident. I'm not sure I need to convince you with this and I can't think of proof but take these thoughts in consideration and try to remember this some other time.

Just be interested. I'm just a schmuck who doesn't know what he's doing but I would like to find out more about (insert topic) then I go do it and experiment on it. I guess that's the summary. If you feel insignificant go back to this post or look for other shy people and see what a shy person can do and believe that you can do something awesome as well.
