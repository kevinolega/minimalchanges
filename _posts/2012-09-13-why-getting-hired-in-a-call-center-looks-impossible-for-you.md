Sometimes you think that you're not qualified. Sometimes maybe you got discouraged.

Maybe you're trying to improve your English. Maybe you're trying to improve your confidence and how you present yourself to others.

If you've never done this kind of thing before you have to give it time and space so you can learn.

Skills can't be mastered in a day. You may understand the concept in one reading but mastering how you communicate your value takes time.

Don't give up because it's hard. You suck because it's your first time.

Pressure doesn't always work so lighten up.

Give it space so you can learn. Give it time so you can grow.
