Call center work is all about offering solutions. Your company is providing outsourced solutions to their clients in the areas of customer service, sales, technical support and others.

When they hire agents the agents will offer solutions to problems on the phone. That's part of everyday life as a call center agent.

You listen to the problem. You clarify the facts and you acknowledge it. As a response you need to offer a solution.

If you're not an agent yet and would like to be, I propose <strong>practice offering solutions</strong>. In fact if you haven't been hired yet I'm thinking, you should start offering yourself solutions to get you hired.

<strong>Here are some examples of solutions I propose:</strong>

If you're not good in English then learn English.

If you're not good with computers learn to use one.

If you want to contact me then find a way to do so.

If you want to learn something Google it.

It's simple right?

Your interviewers are also looking for this trait in you because <strong>you will be offering solutions as part of you work in a call center</strong>. A call center job is not one where you just wait for your boss to tell you what to do. Sure there is a script but you still have to offer solutions on a regular basis. Problem solving skills are essential. If you feel that you have bad problem solving skills then now is the time to start solving that problem.

What questions do you have about offering solutions? I'd like to know in the comments below.
