The simpler the better. You don't need the latest technology all the time. Sometimes it helps. Sometimes it's a crutch.

Just get the work done. Deliver value. Keep doing the work.

I just met a writer who wrote an entire book by hand.

I saw the end product which had the length of a small notebook. When I browsed through it I was amazed to find that there were no corrections.

When I asked him why he said it was the final product already. He said he had a separate notebook for ideas and a separate one for chapters. When he is satisfied he manually copies it into the final notebook.

There's no distraction and he can do it anywhere because nobody will try to steal your notebook.

And here I was troubling myself between using Evernote, Simplenote and plain text via Dropbox.

Being tech savvy doesn't always mean more productive. There are other noise activities. Ones that don't lead to the work.

Technology assisted doesn't always mean you are assisted by technology. Sometimes it's the other way around. You are assisting the technology.

Consider this before your next upgrade.

What are your thoughts? I'm curious. Consider letting me know in the comments below.
