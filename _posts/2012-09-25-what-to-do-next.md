We often have too much on our plate. We say yes to a lot of things that we feel would make our lives awesome. The problem often results in taking in too many projects and tasks. 

Here's a question you can ask yourself to determine the value of what you're doing. If it takes me a really long time to complete this work will I still continue? If you're still game then chances are its important. 

If not then maybe you can put it down for a while and work on what matters. Chances are you can always come back to it. 

Most great work requires a time to grow and if you're not prepared for that you might lose patience.
