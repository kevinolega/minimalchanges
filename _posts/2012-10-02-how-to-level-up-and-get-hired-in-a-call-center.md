In games like Diablo, Warcraft, attack and kill more monsters gain experience and level up.

In DOTA stay in battle kill monsters gain experience then level up.

In FarmVille. Plant more harvest more. Gain experience and level up.

What is the difference between professional players and amateurs?

Professional players play regularly. Amateurs play when they feel like it and stop when they feel like it.

I noticed this strategy works well in most games. In skill based games it's my skill that levels up and not my character. I notice certain patterns in the game that repeats often. When I do I just use what I learned to overcome the challenge I'm facing?

Have you ever finished or achieved a certain level in a game? Maybe you can use it to get yourself hired. If you can prevent yourself from getting killed in a game then maybe you can use the same tactics to get hired in a call center.

If you need to improve your English skills you need more experience talking to someone in English.

Need more confidence? Do something that scares you. Try ordering at a fast food in English or asking for help at practice.

Need more typing speed? Spend more time typing. Write me a letter. Write about your plans when you get hired in a call center. Write about your challenges. Write about your questions and send me an email. I would love to help.

When I started looking for work, I used to have a typing speed of 12 words per minute. That was my maximum. Since I started writing as a hobby then my speed improved gradually. Today, without rushing I can type at 44 words per minute. I didn't even notice.

That's one of the things I notice when I'm playing. I don't notice the time and the improvement. I even wrote a post about improving with play.

Think of it as play and your practice will be effortless.
