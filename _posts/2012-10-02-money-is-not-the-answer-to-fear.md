You don't need to spend to confront your fear. 

Confronting your fear doesn't require money. 

If you confront your fear you don't need to spend as much. 

You don't need to spend as much on things you use to pad yourself against your fear. 

Chances are you have what you need to start right now. 

If fear is crippling you then chances are its telling you to buy something. 

Don't. You're awesome. Now be awesome. 

Your wallet is not the answer to your problems. Facing your fear is.
