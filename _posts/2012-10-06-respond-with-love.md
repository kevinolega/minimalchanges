When things don't go your way it's easy or natural to respond in hate.

When we buy things that we don't really need we respond in fear. 

When we run faster up the upgrade cycle we respond in envy.

I propose responding in love. Things may not go according to plan but it's still awesome and I'm cool with that.

I'm choosing not to buy and let's just cross the bridge when we get there. I'm not too sure about the upgrade but I love what I'm using so I'll put it off til a few years from now.

Budget's a bit tight but I'm choosing to be generous.

Responding with love is a little harder but I find it to be awesome.
