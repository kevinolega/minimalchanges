I'm a really shy person. If you've notice recently that I put up a YouTube channel called CCTTShow that you can subscribe to. I've been trying to make videos to help you with your job application. I recently put up two. You've seen them in my past post. Now why did I do this?

I'm developing a technique you can do at home to work on your shyness. Pull out your video recording app from your phone if you have one or if you can borrow one that also works too. Try reading something and record how you perform. When you're done watch yourself and look at things you need to improve.

Have the courage to look at yourself and what you suck at so you can get better. Notice your facial expression. Notice your voice. Notice how you project your message. That'll improve things a bit.

Watch your show and learn to improve your performance. Great artists do this and I'm sure you can too.
