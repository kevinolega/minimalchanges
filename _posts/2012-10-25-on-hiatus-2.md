Hi friends,

I'm going on an indefinite hiatus. At the moment I felt I've said everything I wanted to say on minimal changes. I already live with less than 100 things, live a frugal lifestyle, have free time and that's all I want for now.

At the moment I'm also resolving personal issues like fear, direction and forgiveness. I'm also trying to resolve some personal issues I'm not ready to share yet.

I'll let you know how it goes when I get back.

It might be a long time until I return here so I'm going to miss you. I hope to come back a better person.

What will I be doing for now?

I started another blog called Call Center Training Tips as a project to help shy people get hired in a call center. I'll be writing some tips there. If you're interested in that feel free to <a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com">visit Call Center Training Tips through this link</a>.

That's it for me at the moment.

I hope to see you soon.

Stay in touch with me. Send me an email at minimalchanges@gmail.com.

Sincerely,

<a href="http://keviolega.com">Kevin Olega</a>
