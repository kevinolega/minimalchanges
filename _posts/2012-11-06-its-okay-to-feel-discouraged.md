Have you ever told yourself that it's impossible? Your dreams are over and so are your plans of a better future? You suck so you can't make it?

You know what? I told myself many discouraging things but I later realized that all discouraging thoughts I have are exaggerated and blown way out of proportion. Chances are yours are too.

The world is not ending yet. Zombies won't rise to eat your brains. The Aztecs haven't predicted the doom of the planet. Don't be scared. I know your fear makes these thoughts feel real.

I won't deny that. Maybe your worst fear will happen but not the way you expect it to. I'm sure that since its exaggerated then your fear is a lot smaller than what you expected.

Discouragement is often exaggerated. What you fear maybe real but what you feel maybe smaller than you think.
