Hi there. I'm doing a test run of the free in person call center training. I'll do it this and next Sunday  January 6,2012 and January 13, 2012 at 2pm to 6pm.

The venue will be at Starbucks at Robinson's pioneer in Boni, Mandaluyong area.

Since we are using Starbucks as a venue please buy a drink or a snack.
If you are on tipid mode a doughnut is Php 60, brewed coffee is Php 90 and hot tea is Php 110 I think.

The session will be for free. I'll present short techniques on how to improve your English skills, confidence, interview skills, customer service skills, tech support skills and many more. After the presentation we will have Q and A.

If you have your resume with you I will teach you how to make it better.

Please bring a notebook and a pen.

You are allowed to bring friends.

To make the most of the session please do the <a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/call-center-job-interview-preparation-questions/">homework</a>.

Also have a list of all the questions that you want to ask.

My mobile number is 639178952637 so call me if you're there already.

Excited to finally see you.
