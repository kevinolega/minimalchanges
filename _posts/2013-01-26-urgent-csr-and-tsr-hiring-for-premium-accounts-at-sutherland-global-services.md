Hi Friends,

My friend at Sutherland Global Services informed me that they are  urgently in need of Customer Service and Technical Support Representatives for their premium accounts.

If you are up to the challenge and have prepared yourself for to get hired in a call center, they are setting up a recruitment hub this <strong>Tuesday January 29, 2012 starting at 11am to screen candidates</strong>.

Simply go there with your resume and an ID.

The address is at the<strong> 9th floor Export Bank Plaza, Don Chino Rocess Avenue, Corner Senator Gil Puyat Avenue, Makati City</strong>.

If you're not prepared. I wrote a list of tips that you can start with so you can go there and get hired on Tuesday. Here's the list:

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/how-to-write-a-resume-for-call-center-application/">Bring an awesome resume</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/improve-conversational-english-skills-fast-with-five-tips/">Practice your English</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/how-to-sound-better-at-call-center-interviews-with-the-sossy-mode/">Speak in Sossy Mode</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/how-to-speak-better-at-a-call-center-job-interview-with-celebrity-mode/">Speak like your favorite English Speaking Celebrity</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/common-call-center-application-pronunciation-errors/%22">Check your pronunciation for errors</a>.</li>
    <li><a title="The Fastest Way To Get Hired in A Call Center: Walk In Applications" href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/the-fastest-way-to-get-hired-in-a-call-center-walk-in-applications/">Just walk in</a>.</li>
    <li><a title="Tips For Walk In Call Center Applications" href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/tips-for-walk-in-call-center-applications/">Get Enough Sleep</a>.</li>
    <li><a title="Archives" href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/archives/">Read my other tips</a>.</li>
</ul>

You are not required to tell them that Kevin of CallCenterTrainingTips.com sent you but if you do it would be as awesome as giving me a hundred likes on facebook.

If you attend the screening and get hired, it would make me happier than you getting me a kiss from Andi Eigenmann or buying me two large pizzas from Shakey's.

I have a limited offer for this job opening. <strong>If you will go to my friend's recruitment hub on Tuesday, I will give you one hour of free over the phone coaching and practice to improve your skills Between Today and Tuesday</strong>. Just text me with your name, Skype, Globe, TM, or landline number, and what time you are going to 63 917 8952637.

<strong>I'm also willing to meet you in person on Monday and Tuesday between 7am to 9am in Makati for 2 hours of coaching, practice and tips. I have work at 10am those days but I'm willing to wake up and leave the house extra early to assist you.</strong>

The opening is not for the faint-hearted but if you do decide to go there you will have my full support.
