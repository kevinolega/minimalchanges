Hi Friends,

This is an update to my previous post. <strong>They have changed their location to the 25th floor of Export Bank Plaza. They are extending their hiring booth for the rest of the week.</strong>

In case you haven't read my previous post, read on to stay up to date.

My friend at Sutherland Global Services informed me that they are  urgently in need of Customer Service and Technical Support Representatives for their premium accounts.

If you are up to the challenge and have prepared yourself for to get hired in a call center, they are setting up a recruitment hub this <strong><del>Tuesday January 29 </del>, Extends this week until February 1,2013 starting at 11am to screen candidates</strong>.

Simply go there with your resume and an ID.

The address is at the<strong> <del>9th</del>  now 25th floor Export Bank Plaza, Don Chino Rocess Avenue, Corner Senator Gil Puyat Avenue, Makati City</strong>.

If you’re not prepared. I wrote a list of tips that you can start with so you can go there and get hired on Tuesday. Here’s the list:

</ul>

You are not required to tell them that Kevin of CallCenterTrainingTips.com sent you but if you do it would be as awesome as giving me a hundred likes on facebook.

If you attend the screening and get hired, it would make me happier than you getting me a kiss from Angel Locsin or buying me two large pizzas from Shakey’s.

I have a limited offer for this job opening. <strong>If you will go to my friend’s recruitment hub on this week, I will give you one hour of free over the phone coaching and practice to improve your skills Between Today and Friday</strong>. Just text me with your name, Skype, Globe, TM, or landline number, and what time you are going to 63 917 8952637.

<strong>I’m also willing to meet you in person on <del>Monday and Tuesday</del> until Friday between 10am to 12pm in Makati for 2 hours of coaching, practice and tips. I have work at 10am those days but I’m willing to wake up and leave the house extra early to assist you.</strong>

The opening is not for the faint-hearted but if you do decide to go there you will have my full support.
