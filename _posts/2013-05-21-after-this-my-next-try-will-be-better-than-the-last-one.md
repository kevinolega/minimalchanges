Whenever I do something I expect the next attempt to get better.

This is a really short post about attitude in your activities. I get a lot of messages lately about people who approach their job application that they want to get hired but somehow give off the message that it would be a waste if they apply and fail or practice and fail or do something and fail. That's a bad way to approach things. So here's my advice on the topic.

Always think of any activity as a learning experience and an opportunity to get better.

If you take on a task with an attitude thinking "It would be a waste if the results are not favorable." then you already wasted an opportunity to learn and get better or you will just waste time because you are bringing a crappy attitude to the table.

Be interested in what you are pursuing and take action.

Mistakes are part of learning.

Look for ways to inch things forward and don't get bitter if things don't go your way.

Sometimes I feel it's a waste if I fail so I don't do anything or don't do things with the right effort. In those cases, I waste my time because the attempt is half-hearted. A lot of you might be afraid to fail or got discouraged from failing. It's okay. Let's move forward.
