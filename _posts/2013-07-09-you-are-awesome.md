Here's the problem, I can't convince you that you are.

Nobody will. In fact you will even encounter many people will try to pull you down. That's life.

In response, you have to look for ways to convince yourself and not talking delusion yourself but instead look for proof.

The Bible has a lot. You are created in the image and likeness of God. So loved, Christ died for your sins to save you. You have so many blessings that you don't even notice every day.

Want to look elsewhere? Start something small. Accomplish small things and build up from there. Each accomplishment is proof. List it down.

I don't really know if you are but I'd like to believe that you are.

I recently met another one who like me had terrible skills to begin with and despite that got hired in a call center and started with absolutely nothing and she's pretty awesome. Listening to her story of researching you tube videos at how to speak better English made me admire her a lot. It wasn't easy, she said but got it done. Every word in the story was sincere and I admire her for that.

Knowing that other people who are like that and just started trying to learn things from the internet on your own well that's pretty amazing so I think you're awesome too anyways you are awesome you need to look for proof because I can't convince you you have to look at what you have try to point out which one makes you awesome and that's the reason why the call center companies are going to hire you.

So its your turn now to tell me. What makes you awesome?
