I published a new section for the site called <a title="Basics" href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/basics/">the basics</a>. It's a list of things that you need to understand before <a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/archives/">reading the lessons</a>.

Skills are useless without understanding the right attitude and mindset. Two people can see two things differently and walk away with different results so I made this list of things of what I believe for you to understand where I'm coming from.

Honestly I'm tired of getting messages from readers who complain a lot. You are looking for call center work friend. Customer service, sales and tech support requires you to be positive and to look for solutions.

If you complain a lot, feel hopeless all the time, and not willing to read, Google or research on how to solve a problem how do you expect to get hired for the position and at this day and age how do you get a job that's not minimum wage and contractual (will automatically fire you in 6 months).

Sure you're old or too young or don't have experience and you don't have a college degree but so do a lot of people who got hired in this job. Stop it with the excuse. Stop asking me for general tips. I wrote as much as I can on the blog already. All you need to do is read them and try them on yourself. You don't even have to pay me.

If that doesn't work out<a title="Services" href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/services/"> you can hire me to teach you or fix your resume</a>.

So here goes. I'm going to ask you nicely. <a title="Basics" href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/basics/">Read the basics</a>. Then <a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com/archives/">read the lessons again</a> and tell me what happens.

I look forward to hearing your "how I got hired stories."
