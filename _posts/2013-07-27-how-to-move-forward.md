<blockquote>The things required to succeed are small, slow, boring and easy. That's why it's so easy to neglect it.
-Kevin Olega</blockquote>



One day at a time.

One step at a time. 

We move forward and build our future.

Our future version and future circumstance are built one day at a time, one step at a time.

"Who I am" and "what I have" is a result of the decisions that I made in the past. 

There will be days when I get impatient. When I will want to cram everything we can into the present. 

We want to bring the future to today to the point that we are willing to jump forward, skip and miss the present by not being present in the process of getting to the future.

Don't miss it. Don't be impatient, You can enjoy the present and build a better future if you pay attention to it. Pay better attention to it.

Don't do too much or you'll burn yourself out and as a result, burn your money up and or backslide. 

Keep moving forward in small steps. Remember why we named this blog minimal changes?

Build spare cash by living a minimalist lifestyle.

Build up spare time by saying no.

Spend 30 days or more before purchasing non food items.

Do the 100 thing challenge. 

Learn to do things instead of buying tools.

Borrow and ask before buying.

Learn skills to be more independent.

Learn skills on activities that you spend the most money on.

Start where you are.

Start now.

Go slow.

Stay Slow.

Use what you have.

Do what you can.

Keep going.

Get better.

The turtle won the race.
