I"m honored that people ask me for tips on how to get hired. You actually don"t need me to get hired. You don"t need to wait for me to teach you. You don"t need me to write your resume. You don"t need to me to answer your question.

When I was younger I used to believe I need somebody to succeed. At times I would wait for weeks, months, even years to get to convince somebody to help me. Things never turned out as planned.

Got a friend who said he will refer you to their company? You can go there yourself.

Got a question you"re waiting for an answer? Google it or you can find out yourself.

Waiting for a response to an email application? Walk in randomly.

Didn"t know how your interview went? Ask the interviewer where you sucked at and ask for tips. When I got used to this, I asked as much questions as I could, extending my interview time to 30 minutes and sometimes an hour. One time the interviewer decided to recommend me for a job offer after just answering my questions.

The last one took the most courage. It also gave me the ability to go to the next interview

Ask your best friend to practice English with you. Tell them to write down every time you made a mistake or said something that didn"t make sense. Discuss the alternatives.

It"s an honor to be asked all these questions but I"m not always online. I have other things going on in my life. I also have <a href="http://kevinolega.com">another blog</a>. I also <a href="http://philippineislandliving.com">travel around</a>. I wrote the tips on this site to answer questions for people so I don"t need to answer them one by one per person.

If you"re asking for some tips please read my tips first and ask for specifics in case I missed out on some details.

Write your own guide. Borrow from the lessons you picked up from this site.

Don"t use lack of something (information or skills) as an excuse for inaction. Instead ask yourself, if I never got (what you are waiting for) what do I do to get what I want?

My answer or whatever you are waiting for won"t bring you closer to your goals. Your first steps will. Go ahead and start don"t wait for me.
