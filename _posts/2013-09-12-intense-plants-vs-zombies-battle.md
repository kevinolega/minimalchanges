I downloaded plants vs zombies 2. It was fun to play but a total time waster. I don't have any doubts that I'll complete the game and unlock all the secrets.

Here's my take.

Learn to build your character in the right reality.

Amass resources that you can use to feed you and push your goals forward.

Build fighting ability where you can defend the people important yo you.

Build faith where you believe the right things.

Consider what is beneficial and what is unnecessary.

Be powerful and skillful where it counts.

Take care of real people where it counts and not just virtual ones.

Build your character in the right reality.

Your real one should be the one levelling up not the one in the game.

What's your take?
