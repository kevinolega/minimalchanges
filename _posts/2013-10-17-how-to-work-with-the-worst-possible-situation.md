Whenever I write, I like silence. The small irritating things get me impatient.

I don't like to hear people talking when I'm working. I don't like to listen to music. I hate it when I hear them playing their music.

I want things to be perfect.

Here's the thing. The perfect situation, almost always never happens. This wrong mindset had caused me to wait and procrastinate. I now have a huge stack of unpublished posts, lessons and a couple of books. I was waiting for the perfect setup and perfect environment. You almost never get both at the same time.

Here's the proposal. **What is the worst possible setup?** 

In my case, it's noise, TV, Music and people talking. 

**Work there. Get used to it.** Complete the task. Don't care about it being the best. Get used to submitting what you have. What you can deliver now and what you can deliver later will get better over time.

That's how you quit smoking. You spent a few days not smoking with your favorite smoking buddy and watched her finish her cigarettes. Hard part's over. now get it done.

Do I really need to explain why this works and what to do next?
