In exactly one year or so, you will achieve your goal.
In exactly one year or so, you will possess that thing you wanted to have.
In exactly one year or so, you will be awesome at skills you sucked at.
In exactly one year or so, you should be thankful for your success.

The goals you set have been achieved. Despite that you feel miserable.
Here's why.

The goals, targets and skills are achieved. They didn't go exactly as you wanted when exactly you wanted to have them. Miracles are achieved. Impossible feats, accomplished. What was fantasy is now reality. Here are the common conditions.

Exactly one year or so after you missed the deadline you set yourself.
Exactly one year or so after you gave up on the goal.
Exactly one year or so after you failed.
Exactly one year or so after you realized there are no shortcuts.
Exactly one year or so after you just begun to work.
Exactly one year or so after you stopped caring.
Exactly one year or so after all that you got what you want.

God does not keep score. Neither should you. All my past goals are accomplished, the ones that are not are in progress, what more should I ask for? There's a saying that all happens as God scheduled, not my schedule. Another eastern religion says that the desire to have things happen at my schedule makes me miserable. You can work, fail give up and achieve a year later. The only alternative is to work on something else or get on with what you're working on.
