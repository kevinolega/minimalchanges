95% of people might disagree with you. 

People will envy you. 

People will say you crazy. 

Sometimes it will drive you crazy. 

You will meet the people who will hate you and misunderstand you sooner. 

If you try to please everyone, especially people you don't like it's a guaranteed failure. 

Kissing ass and sucking things in never really works out at all. 

See past experience for proof.
