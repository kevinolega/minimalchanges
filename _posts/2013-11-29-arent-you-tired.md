When I text or talk someone after saying “Hi, how are you?” my next question is “what’s new with you?” 

To which almost everyone responds almost all the time “still the same” or “Nothing new.”

Aren’t you tired of that? That it’s all the same and that there’s nothing new?

Let me tell you what that means to me if I ever responded to you like that.

I didn’t learn something new.
I didn’t try something different?
There’s nothing I’m absolutely grateful for or happy about.

Everything I’m doing in my life works well and I’m satisfied with the results that I’m getting in all the areas of my life. 

Or.

I’m just secretive about everything and I don’t want to tell you.
