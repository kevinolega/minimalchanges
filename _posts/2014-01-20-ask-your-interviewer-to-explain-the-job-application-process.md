When I started working in a call centre.I had no idea what people are doing. They say customer service. At the back of my head, what the fuck is customer service. When I applied. The guard told me to wait. I said okay. The pretty reception girl, called my name, I went toward her and smiled. She guided me to a computer to fill out my details and I did. When I was done, she called me again and guided me to an interview room. The guy asked me about myself and I answered. I clumsily tried to explain why they should hire me. My over used traits included hard working and honest and I’m really smart. Blah blah blah. I had no idea what I was doing. She asked me to wait outside. The reception attendant guided me to a computer to take the exams. I took the exams. I was asked to record my voice. Do call simulations and come back for another interview. I kept saying yes. I didn’t know what was going to happen next.

I was thinking like a gamer where it’s come what may. I’ll take whatever you throw at me and win. Another part of me says this works to a certain extent and eventually, for tough ones you need to understand the pattern of your challenges and act appropriately. If you need to strike from long range, get close, back stab, go over, slide under, use normal attacks only or all your specials. In games the only time I’m beaten is if I’m hit by an attack that I didn’t expect. The same thing happens in interviews.

I had the “come what may” mindset because I didn’t ask. The truth is, you can ask the question.

I’d say something like “It’s my first time to apply, what does the application process like here?” I sometimes follow up with, “Is it a one day process? A two day process?” I then sneak in, “Can you give me some tips?”

Bonus question: At what stage do you feel, I should take extra care in handling? What are the most common mistakes that job applicants do in that area?

That way you’re aware of what will happen next and bring out your best when you’re at the next part of the process.

If you ask good questions, you’ll get good answers. Knowing something intimately gives us confidence. Confidence allows us to display our skills.

I hope I was able to contribute to you with this short post. I look forward to hearing from you in the comments. Feel free to send me an email.
