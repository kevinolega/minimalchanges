I don't always have an answer ready so whenever I don't and I need time to think of an answer I use delaying tactics.&nbsp; This way I don't give my conversation an awkward silence.

To learn how to do this.

Use delaying words like:
I'm sorry can you repeat that?
What do you mean by "reflect question" ?
That's a good question.
So you are asking about "rephrase question"?
Just to make sure I got that correctly..." rephrase question "
I'm not really sure but...
At the top of my head... I'm thinking..
What's the word for that?
How do you put it? Let me think for a moment.
Smile.&nbsp;

Use your common sense and don't overuse a tactic. I hope you find these useful.
