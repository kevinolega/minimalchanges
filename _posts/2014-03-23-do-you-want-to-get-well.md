Week 4 of 4 questions are answers series. 
John 5:1-12

Some people, when they are hopeless turn to superstition instead of God. 

The setting of the story is called the place of grace where the Jews believed that an angel stirs the water and the first sick person who touches the water gets healed. 

Grace is not on a first come first serve basis. 

Grace means unmerited favor. This means getting something good that you don't deserve. 

Mercy means withholding a consequence that you deserve.

Of God heals or blesses you it is his grace being extended in your life. 

Jesus has the power to heal us. 

Mark 3:5 Jesus heals the man with the shriveled hand. 
Matthew 8:2-3 Jesus touched the man with leprosy and healed him. 
Matthew 13:53-58 Place of unbelief. Jesus did not perform many miracles in his home town because of their unbelief. 

<blockquote>Psalm 103:2-3
Praise the Lord my soul and not forget all his benefits. 
Who forgives all your sins and heals all your disease

</blockquote>
. 

1 Peter 2:24 by His wounds you have been healed. 

Jesus has the power to heal today. 

Today we prayed for people who asked for healing and I saw people report that they had been healed after we prayed for them.&nbsp; 

A few years ago, I saw the same thing happen. God can restore. I put this on my blog to remind myself the power of God in this reality.
