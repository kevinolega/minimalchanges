To be an expert you just need to know what a call center agent does. Dead simple.

A call center representative is someone who takes or makes calls for a company and does a specific business process role. If you’re in customer service, you deal with a customer’s request. If you’re in tech support you give customers instructions on how to fix things and if you’re in sales you sell to customers. Some people prefer one over the other because of their background or personal preference.

<h3>General Attitude</h3>

<strong>1. Excited To Help The Customer.</strong> You need to be genuinely excited to help. That way you will get the customer to cooperate and that will make your job smoother.
<strong>2. Positive Problem Solver.</strong> We come to people for problems. In our roles people come to us to solve a problem. To solve a problem you need to exhibit positivity so your brain can actually think of a solution. If you convey hopelessness, then your brain will go lazy and stop working. You need to see the problem as a tiny harmless thing that can be solve because that’s the reality. If we panic, we end up making mountains out of mole hills. If we practice being a positive problem solver, this will affect how we deal with problems that we encounter in everyday life.
<strong>3. Calm and Cool Listener.</strong> Our initial reaction is to react to hostility and whatever the hell offends us doing the opposite allows us to do better than everyone else. Being a cool and calm listener in every situation allows us to formulate a good plan of action and to do what needs to be done to solve the problem.

Knowing the other jobs allow you to be better at the job you are doing.

Some people say I’ll just take customer service jobs and I don’t give a shit about tech support or vice versa. Knowing the other roles allow you to maximize how well you do with your current role.

Here are the skills that make you awesome at each role.

<h3>Customer Service</h3>

<strong>1. Empathy.</strong> Acknowledge the issue by putting yourself in the customer’s shoes. The last thing you want the customer to say is that you’re not listening and you don’t care. If they see that you care, they are more likely to give you a chance to fix the problem. <em>I’m sorry you’re encountering some issues with the service and I understand it’s frustrating. Don’t worry I’ll take a look into the issue and I’ll help you get this resolved.</em>
<strong>2. Paraphrasing.</strong> You need to make sure you do the job well you need to understand the situation perfectly.<em> Just to make sure I understand you correctly, rephrases the statement or question.</em>
<strong>3. Mastering the process and procedures</strong>. You need to know what happens in the process, at what stage the customer is in the process and what happens next. Knowing the process allows you to set the right expectations and avoid unnecessary frustration.<em> What happens is after you make an order it will take 3-5 business days to receive your widget and once you have it plugged in you can call us to activate the service.</em>

<h3>Sales</h3>

<strong>1. Control the conversation by offering options</strong>. When you offer options you are the one in control. People have difficulty deciding what they want so it’s your job to make it easier for them. <em>Would you want to meet to send you the package next week on Thursday or Friday? Would you like to start with package a or package b?</em>
<strong>2. Recommend the best solution by asking questions.</strong> <em>What do you like about your current product/service? If you can change something or add something to what you’re currently using what would it be?</em>
<strong>3, Handle objections using the Feel, Felt Found technique.</strong> The Feel, Felt Found technique allows you to acknowledge the customer’s perception of the problem without starting and argument and at the same time, present an alternate possible outcome by using proof as experience.<em> I understand that you feel hesitant about getting started, many of our best customers feel the same way but after getting started working with us on their goals, they found out that the benefits of getting started earlier has more benefits than starting later.</em>

<h3>Technical Support</h3>

<strong>1. Knowledge of the product or process.</strong> Every detail counts. You need to know both the technical and how to explain each item in simple words. See 2 and 3.
<strong>2. Explaining steps in detail using simple words.</strong> Knowing both the technical term and the simple/common term allows you to position yourself as an expert and get the customer’s cooperation. <em>When you find the black box please unplug the power cord, wait for 15 seconds then plug it back in. The gadget will power up after one minute and then we can do a test if your connection is working.</em>
<strong>3. Using analogies.</strong> Sometimes the customer is unfamiliar with the technical terms. In order to resolve the issue you need to think of a way to explain the steps well in such a way that they will understand what you’re trying to say. You can explain it easier by connecting what you are trying to say to what they already know.<em> Your internet is like a road that allows you to access information anywhere in the world. The internet speed is like the size and quality of the road so the better it is, the faster you can go. Your computer is like a car the better the car is the smoother the experience as you visit places on the web. Upon checking, it looks like the internet or the road is fine, it’s your computer or your vehicle that’s having trouble. I would recommend getting your computer checked.</em>

Instead of trying to convince you of the value of each skill, let me ask you the following questions.

If you are in a specific role (customer service, tech support, sales) how would you benefit from each skill in the other roles?

What benefits do you see yourself gaining from applying the lesson in real life?
