While making calls have you ever been asked the following questions?

Where are you located?
I don't understand your English.
What? Say that again?
Can you transfer me to an American agent?

If you are getting this often on your calls your pronunciation still sucks.

Here's how to fix it.

<ol>
<li>Write down your spiel.</li>
<li>Read it and record it. Then listen.</li>
<li>Does it sound like an American?</li>
<li>Ask yourself what can I change to make it sound like an American?</li>
<li>Apply the fix until your English is good enough.</li>
</ol>

Be humble and don't be pride full we can all use a little improvement.

What corrections have you found so far?
