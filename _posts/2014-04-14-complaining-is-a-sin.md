Outside of religious context sin also means off target. Or missing the mark. 

So my next target is to go without complaining. 

Lately I've been confrontational at home lately. I yelled at people. I knew it was wrong and I absolutely regret it. It's just that at the heat of the moment, I couldn't control myself. 

Whenever I raise my voice or want to punch someone in the face:
<ul>
	<li>Take a shower. </li>
	<li>Take deep breaths. </li></ul>
Whenever I'm depressed. 
<ul>
	<li>Take a shower. </li>
	<li>Wash my hands. </li>
	<li>Wash my face. </li>
	<li>Go for a headstand. </li>
	<li>Do push-ups. </li>
	<li>Take probiotics. </li>
	<li>Drink water. </li>
	<li>Write about today's blessings. </li>
</ul>
Whenever I feel bad about myself. 
	<ul>
<li>Remember the sacrifice of everyone who helped me get to where I am today. </li>
</ul>
Don't ever complain. That's the next target. Do something about it. Pray about it. Pray for solutions. Ignore it. Make it your next target. Don't complain. 

Challenge accepted!
