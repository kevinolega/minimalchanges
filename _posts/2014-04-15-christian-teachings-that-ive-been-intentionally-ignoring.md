<blockquote>Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tender- hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.
</blockquote>

This is harder than it looks. One of the the harder things to follow when you becomes Christian. It's easy not to kill people now because we had put a good measure of consequence for violence. 

What are the benefits. You'll live a peaceful life. Free of burden amid hate which makes things heavy for you. This frees up your mental ram so you can do something productive. This opens up opportunities for you because practicing compassion forces you to be creative with your solutions. It could be personal growth or financial in nature depending on what is needed at the moment. 

These are the traits of successful people that I admire. The principle seems simple enough but is difficult to follow. 

The hard things to do is also simple. I don't have this yet. I would love to have this in me. I admit I don't want this at all. Mostly because of the hard work involved.Despite that,my answer is challenge accepted. 

<em>Note: the verse is from Ephesians 5:31-32 NASB. </em>
