There are many things that you can do to get hired in a call center. These are the top two that worked for me.   <strong>Walk in applications</strong>. Just go to a call center recruitment area and apply. Tell them you're applying for the post or you'd like to inquire about open positions then hand in your résumé.  <strong>Online applications</strong>. It's doing the same thing online. Create a Jobstreet and jobsDB account then send your application to every company hiring for your position. Prepare to get phone interviewed then just show up as scheduled.  What I like about the top two approaches is I don't have to wait for my friend to refer me or something external to move me forward. The more cards you have in your hand the better negotiating power I have when it comes to salary negotiations so I make sure I have a good number of companies to visit. The more options I have the more relaxed I feel about every interview because I know that if I make a mistake I'm just going to go to the next company on my list and take what I learned from the previous company interview and use it on the next one.  What methods got you hired the last time?
