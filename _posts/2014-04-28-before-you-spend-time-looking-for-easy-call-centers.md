I want to tell you something.

I meet a lot of people who want to work in a call center. There are a lot of people looking for easy call centers to apply to. The problem with that approach is as you visit more easy centers and fail you stand to lose more and more opportunities because you have less call centers to go to if you failed.

An alternate would be to get better at what you are bad at.

If your English is not good get better at introducing yourself, asking questions and telling stories.

If its your people skills learn to conduct good conversations. Be interested in what other people are interested in and encouraging them to talk about themselves.

If it is confidence then you need to know what specifically you are good at and practice delivering a good explanation on why you are a good person to hire.

Finding the easy puts you in a space of shrinking opportunities. Learning to get better increases the opportunities that you encounter over time.

It looks more painful but over time you realize both require the same effort. The other one though more intimidating has more upside.

Let me end with this.

The amount of success and happiness in your life is directly proportionate to the amount of uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have. If you decide to postpone the difficult conversations in your life right now, you will encounter even harder conversations and situations in the future.

Would you be willing to spend a little more time in getting better now or would you rather put your future in the hands of random circumstances?
