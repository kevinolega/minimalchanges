I picked up a phone and didn't return it. My job got upgraded a few months after.

While working in a call center, I picked up a Nokia n95 back when it was hotter than an iPhone. It belonged to a supervisor in a company that I worked for. I got fired shortly after. I returned the phone thinking to myself "God created me to be strong enough to buy my own phone." I hated God then because I believed that we don't need God because He created us to be powerful enough to fend for ourselves. Now I pray regularly and ask God for help. Doing the right thing once doesn't guarantee good things happening.

You see I got fired because I kept falling asleep on the sleeping area. At one point I got to the office early, fell asleep and woke up the next day. I was younger and I didn't take care of my body. I smoked. I was an alcoholic. I didn't eat right.

It was my fault mostly. But being young, I didn't see the value in most things. I'm twenty eight at the time of writing this post. Here are a few lessons from my bad call center experiences.

<strong>1. Recognize that you are young and stupid</strong>. I didn't know a lot of things but I never admitted it. As a result I ignored wisdom that could have helped me landing the job sooner and making my goals reality.
<strong>2. Be humble enough to ask for wisdom</strong>. I felt like I can do everything myself that's why I end up figuring things out on my own. Taking things alone is a longer process than having mentors and people to get advice from. My life took a long positive turn shortly after meeting mentors and getting advice from people who have what I want.
<strong>3. Life is hard but failures are opportunities to learn how to do better in the future</strong>. These days I see everything as a game. I always ask myself. Is my character strong enough to overcome "insert challenge"? If not what skills do I need to develop and what level should I reach to achieve my goals? Then I practice like a gamer would. I start from level one until I reach level twenty or whatever skill level I need to achieve my goal.
<strong>4. Taking care of your body enables you to achieve your goals more than you think</strong>. It's true. With alcohol I'm often not thinking straight. With smoking I lose stamina and the energy to do more things. I have asthma and I used to be a chain smoker. I can't count how many times this nasty habit had fucked me up in the past. Sure I meet a lot of pretty girls with the "can I borrow your lighter pickup line" but there are better ways. There are always better ways to do things.
<strong>5. Understanding your limitations enables you to do really well at what you can actually do</strong>. I'm not good at people skills but I'm good at learning games. When I learned to see things as a game, I developed the ability to do really well with my people skills. I know my weakness and know what I'm good at. Games are easy to figure out because there's a stat sheet of every skill there is for the character. When we apply this to real life it's not hard to do the same thing in games.

As you get wiser you can connect the dots more, learn from your mistakes and make better decisions. Don't see your failures and bad experiences as permanent. Know that you'll eventually be at least a hundred times more awesome than you are now. Have faith. I type this on an iPad mini. For several years I was too broke to buy myself a nice phone. I bought this gadget a few moths ago brand new wit cash? Did I get lucky or did I get better? Maybe a bit of both. I know God supplied me with the money by giving me bad experiences so I can eventually know how to get things done that eventually leads me to do and enjoy  awesome things. That's how I connect it so far. Don't be short sighted. Sometimes short cuts are short term. Don't fuck yourself by taking the easy way all the time. If you pick up a phone return it. Do the right thing and eventually things will get better for you.

One of the perks of writing for a blog is I get to meet people and share ideas.
What challenge are you facing now?
What do you think you need to achieve your goals?
Do you have specific questions that I can help you with?
Tell me your story. I'd love to hear from you.
