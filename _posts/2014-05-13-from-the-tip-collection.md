The Most Brilliant Answer To The Dreaded Salary Question: What is Your Expected Salary?

To be honest I have no idea how to answer the salary question.

If I know what I'm worth, say my past salary is so and so I usually add five to ten thousand then I wait for their counter offer.

<blockquote>My safest answer is..
I heard that the pay here (or in this industry) ranges from say 20,000 - 30,000 and I have x number of years of experience in this field, I would like it to be closer to insert desired amount.</blockquote>

I've also done salary negotiations when it comes to the hiring process. As an interviewer, all I did was hope that the applicant's asking salary matches the budget that my boss gives me and then I try to bring it down by a few thousand pesos if needed.

Almost every salary question that I've researched is a bit vague and will lead to the question whether the applicant's asking salary match the company's budget.

Lifehacker writer Mihir Patkar shared an answer that totally blew me away. It's absolute genius and I intend to add this to my answers in case I'd need to get another job.

<blockquote>"Look, I'm not sure what the fair price here is, but you probably know that. And it's in your best interest as much as mine that I get a fair price. If I get hired and find out that the price is unfair, I'll try to jump ship and you will have to go through this process again. It means more job-hunting for me, more employee-hunting for you. So if we can just do a good, fair deal right now, it helps us both."

They talked among themselves and came up with a new price that was fairer than the initial offer.</blockquote>

What do you think? It totally blew me away. I'm so excited I think I want to test it on an application, even if I don't need another job.
