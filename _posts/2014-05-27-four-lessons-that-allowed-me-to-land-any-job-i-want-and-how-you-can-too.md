A change of attitude is all you need to get your dream job. I don’t mean just a call center job, I mean any job that you want.

<blockquote><strong>For things to change, I need to change. - Jim Rohn</strong></blockquote>

Once you have changed your attitude, getting the skills needed to achieve your goals becomes many times easier.

Your attitude is influenced by what you believe about yourself. What you believe about yourself is influenced by the words you use.

There is no easy way to change your attitude. Most of my attitude change is a result of me being exposed to other people’s beliefs and attitudes. If I admire or like a person and they have the results that I want, I copy what I find useful. I study how they respond to situations and as I understand why the attitude works and eventually I adapt some into my own beliefs.

<strong>1. It’s not the situation, it’s my response that affects the end result.</strong> Some people are born with gifts and have bad results. Some people start from nothing and gain the life they want. The reality is, no matter how bad or good a situation becomes, how you play what you are given determines the outcome. It’s what you choose to do with the time given to you.
<strong>2. I am a problem solver.</strong> Companies pay me to solve their problems. That’s a fact. If there are no problems they wouldn’t need to hire me for anything. I see difficulty as an opportunities that I can take advantage of to help myself and others.
<strong>3. My confidence and skill level determines the size of challenges that I can overcome.</strong> If I work on my skills hard enough, it will reach a level where I can make money and be happy at the same time. Top performers are never sad about their jobs. My confidence influences my skill level. If I believe I can I can try. Even if I fail, I can learn to do better. If I have no faith in myself, I cannot move forward. I believe I am God’s masterpiece, I should act like one.
<strong>4. Large challenges can be overcome if you take on it part by part.</strong> There’s no other way. If I want a job, I need to learn the skills involved. To learn the skills involved, I start with one of the skills. To learn a skill, I need to study, imitate and practice the steps until I can do it right. After I learn to do it right, I keep practicing until it’s so automatic I can’t do it wrong.

This process works for martial arts, this process works for cooking. This process works for learning a language. This process works for any game I’ve played. This process works for finding a job.

I know this because at one point I was once just like you. I had no idea what I was doing. I had a girlfriend then that inspired me to dream bigger and to do better and I didn’t know how. I just knew I had to do it so I did what I had to do. I learned from wherever I can. I practiced on a bus. I practiced on strangers. I practiced on the interviewer. I felt so embarrassed but I felt that if I didn't make something out of myself I’ll stay hopeless, leaving my fate to chance. As I learned steps, I learned skills. As I learned skills, my confidence increased naturally. As my confidence increased, I performed well at anything that I did. As I performed better, my pay got better, my life got better, my everything else got better.

I can’t be your girlfriend, but I can write about my experience to show you what I did so you can do the same.

<blockquote><strong>If I can’t slay the beast of despair with my massive sword of confidence, I’ll paper cut it to death one positive affirmation at a time.</strong>
<strong>-Sekou Andrews</strong></blockquote>
