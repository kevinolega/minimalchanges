Sometimes you pick up a leson and it stays in your head then you genuinely realized that you need to apply it to your life.

> If your answer is not "HELL YEAH!" don't do it at all. - Derek Sivers

These days I've been saying yes to a lot of things. 

I'm really happy where all the new experiences took me. 

I noticed that I've been saying yes to invitations that I don't feel like going to or activities that I don't feel like doing.

I literally hate my life for saying "uhhhm, okay" to a lot of things. 

I feel like I'm spread too thin. 

I'm not doing anything meaningful because I fucked up everything I've done in the past few months.

I end up using resources I had previously intended to use else where. 

I'm not getting enough sleep and it ruins my ability to get things done.

Here are things I don't say often but I'm practicing to say.

1. I don't feel like going.
2. I have something for that day, I'm not exactly sure what it is (or I remember that I said yes to a friend already I just have to check my calendar for to confirm) but I'll let you know if anything changes.
3. That' not a priority right now (side note: don't feel the need to tell them what they are doing. I have the error of counting the hours required and trying to squeeze the yes in. Stop! We are the worst people at estimating the time required to complete a task. One time I told a friend it would take me a few days to write an article an it'll take me a few minutes to write one but it totally didn't work out because I didn't realize then that a few minutes means waking up fresh and it didn't happen too much then because I was saying yes to too many things.)
4. I would love to but my resources are limited (at this time). This is the real answer. I'm disgusted at myself for playing the poverty card. I always want to look good in front of my friends. Bad decision. I'm lying to people in their face. I'm actually broke. I have money. I have time but that time and money is committed or intended for someone or something else. I'm not broke as a result of spending all my money but I'm allocating my resources to what I personally want to go after.

Lately I've been learning from my former boss who's a really successful Christian businessman and he has a habit of telling people he doesn't have the money to pay for it. I felt like he's a loaded with money and the statement is bullshit so I confronted him and called him in because I felt like lying. He told me that the reason why I'm broke is that I unconsciously use up my resources to try and please other people instead of working to achieve my goals. I need to learn to be unapologetic with what I want to do. If people tell me you run a blog that shares money advice and disclosed how I successfully saved money, I should tell them that my money goes somewhere. I don't have to use my money to solve other people's problems.

I'm glad I am learning this now compared to learning this in the future. What are you doing to allocate resources for your goals?
