I'm not always an idiot. I'm pretty good with some tests. Math, English IQ exams are pretty easy for me. I found out that most exams for job application are far easier than what they torture use with back in school.

After benign given tips by my interviewer, I was asked to sell an item and I passed too. On to a later stage, the interviewer asked me to speak to an american over the phone. The person on the phone told me that he's never been to the Philippines before and  asked to describe the Philippines to him.

I imagined squatters areas, dog shit on the streets, prostututes, corrupt government officials, scandals, etc.

I couldn't say anything.

I was told they'll just call me. They never did.

Later that day, I went to my friend and asked him how he'd answer the same situation. His answer was dramatically different than mine. The answers were direct and simple. He chose to highlight the positive. I can't remember his answer in verbatim. I just remember him starting with. That's easy. Then he said. In no particular order.

<h2>The Philippines is...</h2>

<ul>
<li>A melting pot of cultures</li>
<li>The hub of asia</li>
<li>Easy to adapt to because of all the people who can speak in English.</li>
<li>Low cost of living</li>
<li>A nice place to be.</li>
</ul>

If you are positive, you have more opportunities to move forward because it enables you to offer solutions to problems that you encounter. The good news is that if you are not positive now you can learn to be positive little by little and it eventually becomes part of you.
