Whatever your job is, you will be a problem solver. Your job is a solution to a problem. That's what they hire you. That's why they pay you money. If you want to make more money or to perform better, you need to be able to solve more problems for more people. That's just how things are.

I was crappy at my job at some point in my life. My boss always yelled at me. I was embarrassed because I look up to my boss a lot. Then I realized I forgot I was a problem solver. My next question was, how do I solve my boss' problems, by working on solving my personal problems. I wrote down the things my boss complains about. On a separate sheet of paper, I wrote down what was wrong with me, what was happening, and what I can do to change it. Then I wrote down the step that I can do. On a separate sheet of paper, I drew Deadpool and I know it's totally unrelated but whenever I'm stuck for ideas, I draw something.

Bad things happen and many things we value don't often go the way we intended or according to our expectations.
The Bible says "in this life we will have troubles" my favorite martial artist says "don't pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a hard one." Don't wish it was easier. Wish you were better.
Whenever we face conflict, we encounter a fight or flee response and as a result, whenever we face problems, we don't handle it well. The goal of this post is to encourage you. When you encounter problems...
Don't fight it. These things happen. Fighting causes problems to escalate.
Don't flee from it. These things happen. Running away from problems enable it to grow.
The only way to deal with a problem is by facing it.
Don't react with your first idea for a solution. The first is usually an emotional one or crappy one.
Use paper. Write down your ideas. On paper a problem is clear and smaller. One of the fastest ways to cut a problem down to the right size is by writing down its details on paper.
Complex math problems are dealt with on paper. Sometimes with the aid of tools like a calculator. Life's problems also require the same approach.
Make sure to use options. The more choices you have the smaller the problem becomes.
For simple stuff write down three to five ideas for solutions then make your pick.
For complex and important problems, write down ten or more possible solutions.
Always pick the best one.
A solution may be effective based on quality, convenience and cost.
The idea there is that when you pick a solution, you need to decide what kind of end result you want and make your decision accordingly.
Many times, the best solution is one that I can do now.
I'll pick a good solution for my problem over the perfect solution for a problem but takes a long time to execute.
Did the solution work? If yes, good. If no, try something else.

It's okay to make mistakes as long as you don't repeat the same one.
