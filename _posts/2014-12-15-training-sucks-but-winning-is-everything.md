Training sucks

But winning is everything

I was walking around Ayala one day and I saw a fat guy with a shirt that says <em>"Training sucks"</em> in front then a hundred or so thoughts go through my head.
- I remember Martial Arts training
- I remember sales training.
- I remember customer service training
- I remember entrepreneurship training.
- I remember culinary training.
- I remember the value each of the trainings had on me.
- I remember how each of the skills I had sucked until after the training.

I suddenly hated the fat guy. I found the message on his shirt offensive. As I passed judgement on him, thinking the guy is a loser I asked myself, is that the only thing there is to his message? "Training sucks?" WTF right? I looked at his back and surprisingly, I saw the continuation. A punchline of sorts. It said. "But winning is everything." I suddenly felt that I could relate with the fat guy. In a lot of situations, training sucks. It's not always enjoyable. Your weaknesses will be revealed. Bad habits will be broken. New habits will be learned. Many things that you're not familiar with will be introduced and it will be awkward. You will make mistakes and maybe some people will laugh at you.

Here are some trade offs.
- You will learn a useful skill that nobody can take away from you.
- If anyone else wants to learn the skill you are working on now, they will have to go through exactly the same (possibly painful) process and hardships that you are going through.

Training sucks, but winning is everything. Winning is not everything for me. I'm not willing to do unethical things to win. Except maybe kick someone in the balls in a fight. I try not to do so. But in my excitement my foot finds its way there.

In this post I don't want to highlight winning is everything. What I want to highlight is the value of training.

Training teaches you:
- The objectives and tasks
- The skills and steps.

Training enables you to win because it teaches you what to do and what to do well.

Let me try to explain more clearly.

Each dream has goals. Goals requires some tasks to be completed. Tasks require skills or a combination of skills.

If your goal is to get hired in a call center, here's a breakdown of what is needed:

<h3>Three Job Offers</h3>

To get hired in a call center where you're really happy with the job I recommend having three job offers. You can have more than 3-5 but you generally need three to choose one where you'll be satisfied with the offer.

<h3>Ten good interviews</h3>

Ten good interviews doesn't mean you need a job offer at the end. These are interviews where you felt you've given your best. You came prepared and you delivered your best introduction, you arrived on time, you gave them a clean resume. You felt you explained clearly what makes you a good fit for the job and win or lose you've given it your best so you feel it is a good interview.

<h3>Five bad interviews.</h3>

None of us are professional job applicants. This might be the first time in a long time where you're applying for a job. You're a bit rusty with your introductions. You don't know the area and you arrive late or worse, looking like a mess. There's an interview answer that you feel would be a good answer that's actually a bad answer. You're not confident with your delivery and hesitating with your answer makes the interviewer think you're giving them bullshit. You haven't read about how to prepare for an interview and you forgot something important. I experience this all the time. I've switched jobs many times and I'm sure I've messed up at least three interviews every time I switch jobs. You know those examples I'm giving out? I've had these problems. I know them well because I've encountered these problems personally. The good news is nobody gives a shit about you enough to keep a record of who you are and your past mistakes. So the next interview is always an opportunity to do better. If you're playing a game and you die, you can try again. Same thing happens with interviews. You might use time and money to play but you get experience and you get to play better.

<h3>A list of fifteen companies you're going to</h3>

It's hard to remember objectives when things get emotional. As I've said, you might make a few mistakes and it will cause you to want to quit. It's embarrassing to make mistakes. The three hardest words in the English language are "I don't know" we have a hard time admitting we are wrong. I guess the second hardest is "I messed up". Whenever the emotions are high we end up doing dumber things until we reach our lowest point. It takes practice and a few skills and lots of reminders to pick yourself up from a fall. I smoked a lot when I felt bad. I spend a lot of money when I'm depressed. We both know those things are harmful but when you're there and the emotion is felt, it's extremely hard to resist. A list tells you that you haven't done everything you can yet. If you feel like quitting and you haven't crossed off every company yet, then you have work to do, you'll tell yourself. Make a list and visit each company. Walk in if you have to. Just cross out every company on the list.

<h3>Fifty Online Applications</h3>

If you're looking for a call center job, you'll just need to send out applications. This is both the easiest step and the reason why most people fail. It's also easy not to do. All you need to do here is put up your resume on Jobstreet and JobsDB and submit an application to fifty companies. It'll take you maybe two hours and you'll just need to send the applications.

<h3>A simple resume</h3>

A resume is simply a piece of paper with your contact information, work history and skills. Make sure it tells them what you were responsible for and in charge of. Highlight skills and experiences that you might find useful. Do not include your personal info like height and weight, you're applying for call center work and not as a promo girl.

<h3>Money to get started.</h3>

If you're going to quit your job, or something don't do so until you can support yourself. If you have bills to pay or responsibilities due to people you are supporting, don't do so until you have enough money. Here's my computation and these are based on my situation. I live in Paranaque and I applied for Jobs in Makati and Ortigas. Some days I spend Php 100 - Php 150 on transportation and Php 50- Php 100 on food. It's always cool to have extra money for other expenses. I strongly recommend that you make a computation based on your situation but if you want a quick estimate or a format.
One month of expenses.
150 for transportation per day
100 for food per day
Multiply it by twenty days for job application and fifteen days for going to work until your first paycheck. That's a total of thirty five days days for your job application process and time until your first paycheck.
Other expenses include:
- Php 150 to print your resume
- Php 60 for three hours of computer shop time.
- Php 300 for NBI clearance or so.
- Php 70 for ID pictures (I get mine from tronix)

Some people ask me to train them for free because they have zero money. That's a bad idea. I don't train them at all. If you have zero money, you won't get hired because you need money to go to work.

At one point my money went to zero. To compensate I looked for a job that paid me Php 200 pesos a day for a few hours of work until I have enough money to look for work in Makati and Ortigas. That's the largest drop in pay I've experienced but I did what I needed to do. Two years after I was able to negotiate almost twice my highest salary.

Getting hired in a call center looks complicated at first but I want to point out that it is only a combination of small tasks that are put together. If you train yourself to do the tasks, you can achieve your goals.

What are your thoughts? Do you have the same experience as I did? Please leave a comment on the blog.
