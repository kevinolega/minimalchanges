My current favorite TV Series is Hannibal. It's a tv show about a genius eccentric cannibal serial killer Hannibal Lecter and how he got caught prior to his appearance in the film Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs

The scenes that stood out for me were the dialogue during the scenes when he was attempting to convert Will Graham, the protagonist who will capture him to the dark side and make him a killer.

Here are a few.

<blockquote>**Hannibal: Killing must feel good to God too. He does it all the time. And are we not created in his image?**
** Will: That depends who you ask.**
** Hannibal: Godâ€™s terrific. He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshippers last Wednesday night in Texas, while they sang a hymn.**
** Will: And did God feel good about that?**
** Hannibal: He felt powerful.**

**Will: What do you think about when you think about killing?**
** Hannibal: I think about God.**
** Will: Good and evil?**
** Hannibal: Good and evil has nothing to do with God. I collect church collapses. Did you see the recent one in Sicily?**
** The facade fell on 65 grandmothers during a special mass.**
** Was that evil? Was that God? If he's up there, he just loves it.**
** Typhoid and swans,it all comes from the same place.**

**Hannibal: I've given up good and evil for behaviourism. Then you can't say that I'm evil.**
** Will: You're destructive.**
** Hannibal: Same thing. Evil is just destructive? Storms are evil, if it's that simple and we have fire, and then there's hail.**
** Underwriters lump it all under "acts of God".**
** Is this meat (referring to a victim) an act of God, Will?**</blockquote>

I disagree on some points but the flow of the logic seemed convincing especially if you have lost someone important to you. I often ask myself what I could learn from my experience that I could use for good instead of the opposite which is clearly where things are going.

I asked myself a question.

**"What else does God enjoy doing?"**

I have received a lot of grace (unmerited favor) from God. That means I get good things despite the fact I don't deserve it. I have also received forgiveness and patience from God.

If we were to twist the dialogue a little bit.

**Giving must feel good to God too.. He does it all the time. Are we not created in God's image?**

My question before I end. When you imitate God by giving to others or forgiving or being patient, do you feel good or powerful?

I feel a little bit of both.
