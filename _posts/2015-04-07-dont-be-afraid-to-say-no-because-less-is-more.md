Too much leads to overwhelm to eventually loss of focus.

What are the top two things that are causing my unhappiness?

Discard one. Repeat.

What are the top two things that are causing my unhappiness?

Discard one. Repeat if you see the benefits from discarding the first two.

You just made space available for what's important.

You don't need the other activities or items as much as you think.

Don't continue.&nbsp;

It's okay to not finish something unimportant or unsatisfying. If there are no negative consequences, quit as many unimportant or unsatisfying activities as you can.

Quitting is not bad when applied to the right things.

Clean things up. Discard the trash.

Shift the focus from what you accumulate to what you become.

Having less makes output efforless because less means focus.

It may sound counterintuitive if you're reading this for the first time but..

Less is more.
