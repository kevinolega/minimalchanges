I want you to imagine a concert. It could be your favorite pop group, singer, DJ or rock band depending on the type of music you like. Now in this scenario there are two groups the performer who came to perform and the spectators who came to watch the show.

I believe it's important to know the difference because almost everywhere in life there are performers and there are spectators.

When I started working the company who hired me taught us this distinction. The performer and the spectator are two roles that I have the option of choosing at any point in my life and I may decide on being one but I can't be both. If you're willing I'd like to teach you the same lessons, why it's relevant and how you can benefit from the two words.

A performer is someone who is open to criticism despite their best efforts.

A spectator recieves no criticism.

A performer gets paid to participate.

A spectator gets paid to participate.

In the end our results depend on whether we decided to play the role of a performer or the role of the spectator.

When you decide to be a performer you will be exposed to mistakes, ridicule, criticism, embarrasment, negative comments. If you would like to permanently avoid these things you may choose to "be nobody and don't do anything."

All performers are exposed to negative situations but the things is, life is determined by how we respond to the situations and challenges that we encounter in life.

We have no control of our situation but we do have control over our attitude and words and actions.

The performer practices control.

The spectator allows circumstances to take control.

Let's consider a few things. I'll need you to grap a pen and write down the following questions.

<ol>
    <li>What do I want in life?</li>
    <li>What kind of person do I want to be?</li>
    <li>What activities and accomplishments do I want to do?</li>
    <li>What is my plan to achieve them?</li>
</ol>

If I answered the following questions and put specific details then you are likely to be a performer or you're on your way to being a performer already. If not then you can pause and try answering again. The good thing about this choice is you can change your mind. At any time in your life you may decide to be a performer or a spectator.

If you would like to follow the path of the performer here are some tips I've learned from experience.

<ul>
    <li><b>Learn a few things</b></li>
    <li><b>Make it your hobby</b></li>
    <li><b>Spend some time on it.</b></li>
    <li><b>Develop your skills</b></li>
    <li><b>Test your skills by showing it to others.</b></li>
</ul>

<b>
</b><b>Whether you pass or fail get feedback.</b>

<ul>
    <li>What am I doing right? (continue and improve)</li>
    <li>What am I doing wrong? (adjust and correct)</li>
</ul>

A few years ago, I decided to be a performer and my life changed. Unfortunatly, I can't tell you what it's like you have to experience it for yourself.

On this site, I do my best to make myself available to answer your questions. Please leave a comment or send me an email or a message on the facebook page. I hope you decided to follow the path of the performer. A performer is someone who makes no excuses and is focused on getting better at their craft. If you need help please don't hesitate to reach out.
