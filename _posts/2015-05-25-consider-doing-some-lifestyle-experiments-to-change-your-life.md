Hi there. In the past few days I realized how long it's been since I started this blog. Between that time and today, I was going to business and personal development workshops, reading Zen Habits, Tim Ferris and Colin Wright and a few others.

I've learned a few small things that had changed my life. I became a minimalist, a Christian, a bicyclist, a polymath, an autodidact, a home chef, a CrossFit guy, an online content marketing expert, a meditation guy, &nbsp;a better money manager and investor, and that's all that I can think of at the top of my head.&nbsp;

Some principles stuck out.

<b>80/20 rule.</b> 20% of the input is responsible for 80% of the output. Always ask yourself what's the 20% of the tasks that are responsible for the positive results and which 20% of tasks are responsible for 80% of the negative reults.

<b>Start with as little as possible. </b>I realized that one consistent formula for failure in my life is the fact that I over commit and over extend myself. I set a huge ass goal and I set a huge ass commitment of 20 tasks per day. Guess what happens? I mess up. I hate myself. I quit. I learned to cook with a 200 peso knife and making one meal a week. I started getting fit with 5 push ups a week. I started my investment fund by allocating 500 pesos per payday. Same thing with my charity activities. It's okay to start small. It's okay to stay small. Eventually, when you're ready, growth will occur. The goal is to learn skills, to learn do tasks at will and to form habits. Derek Sivers said that you'll need to build the one percent prototype. Your version 0.01 and launch it immediately.

Mastery is easier than you think. People mistake mastery from perfectionism. Mastery is simply learning a few important principles and tasks by heart and executing it well and perfection is something that takes a lifetime.&nbsp;

<b>Skills are a matter of learning a few words and what they mean and how they apply</b>. A chef knows a set of words intimately. Examples would include ingredients and kitchen related tasks. An investment guy also has their own sets. So does other skills. If you want to learn a few skills, just learn the words, what they mean and how to apply them.

<b>Better a kick ass half than a half assed whole.</b> I learned this from Jason Fried of 37signals. You need to forgive yourself with the level you've reached right now. Stop at the point where you've done well and don't push it. You'll run out of gas on the next task.

With that, I'll end here and share more lessons on my next posts. I hope to see you soon.
