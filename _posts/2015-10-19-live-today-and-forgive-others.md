Hey guys. Today is my birthday. Instead of a really long post, here are two lessons I pondered the past week. These lessons are not new. I feel you've heard these several times already, despite that, I never paid attention to them. Since my recent misfortune in the past few weeks, these two lessons have been really useful in dealing with the frustration.

Here goes.

<strong>Live today</strong>. Don't be distracted by the past or future. I spend too much time dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. I've been doing so for several years. I got too tired of it. I'm currently learning to put the focus on today. Two thousand years ago, Jesus taught the disciples "The Lord's prayer" and said "give us today our daily bread" because today is what matters. I've been on the planet for thirty years and I've never starved. I'm actually a little over weight. I recall going dizzy from hunger once or twice but that was because I forgot to eat. Don't make this an excuse to do unwise things with your resources. Do wise things with your resources. Just don't forget to live today.

<strong>Forgive others</strong>. If I had the same circumstance, education, background, environment, experience as the people I hate, resent and look down upon I am likely to do the exact same thing. As Jesus was dying on the cross he prayed "Father forgive them, they don't know what they're doing." The Christian world consider's  him God. The non Christian world consider's him a "high level wise man." I put these assumptions together and imagine it makes sense. Jesus was not given "milk of the poppy before his crucifixion." I imagine there was a profound lesson in this scenario. If Jesus was God or extremely wise, what does "forgive them, they don't know what they're doing mean?" People do the best that they can with the resources that they have. If people are clumsy with their words, would it be difficult to imagine that they didn't have the training you did to be diplomatic with your speech. If a person was rough, don't you think they have encountered hardships?  I hated my dad because of how I was treated when I was younger. If I became really specific, I would come to the conclusion that I didn't hate him. He isn't as evil as I thought. I was unable to handle how my dad communicates. It occurs to me that my dad didn't practice diplomacy or persuasion with me.  Then again who the hell consciously practices diplomacy or persuasion with family members? Not everybody does it. Its a software limitation. Not part of a person's program. It can be copied but it is not built in. People are not at fault with their conclusions because their choice is not fully their own. There are other factors involved. It's often too complicated to blame others for an event that's we are not happy with.
