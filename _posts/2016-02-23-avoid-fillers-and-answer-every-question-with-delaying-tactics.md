I admit it. I don't have all the answers all the time. In some situations I'll need to Google or think of an answer. It doesn't take forever to think of an answer. Many answer take a few seconds. We all know own that thinking of good answers to questions require time. In a lot of situations you just have to give it ten to fifteen seconds and go with what you have. Half the time it turns out well. Half the time I give a silly answer and I correct myself half way through my answer.

I believe you are pretty smart after all you spend your time reading to develop your self. Other people only cry and complaining about life.

Here are delaying tactics that I use a lot to control the conversation and buy me time to think of the good answers. . Note : uhhhs and uhmmms make you sound stupid. 
- Well
- That's interesting or that's an interesting question. 
- Pause and smile
- Hmmm
- Let me think about it for a second.
- Give me a moment.
- So you...(rephrase)
- I'm not too sure but the answer I have at the top of my head is...
- I think...
- I believe...

If you use uhh, uhmm, ahh before answering questions or between sentences, you give people (customers and interviewers) the impression that you don't know what you're saying. You will fail to sound calm and cool.

Just so you know your goal in an interview is to sound calm and cool in the face of questions that you don't know the answer to. That's the reason why they throw you unexpected questions like what's your favorite good and how would you describe red to a blind person.

Anyways I'll leave it at that. Give it a try. Practice then let me know how it works out for you. Send me a message if you think of better examples. I'll add it to the list.
