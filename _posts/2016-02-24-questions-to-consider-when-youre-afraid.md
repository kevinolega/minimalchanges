Would you be willing to...

Would you be willing to move forward to achieve what you want?

Would you be willing to get rejected 100 times to get an awesome yes?

Would you be willing to ask questions to know the answer? Even if you are afraid?

Would you be willing to try something you haven't tried before to see what happens? Even if you can fail because you're unfamiliar.&nbsp;

Would you be willing to know your weakness from other people so you know what to improve on?

Would you be willing to know your strangths so you know what to do more often?

Would you be willing to risk looking weak so you can learn to present a better tomorrow?

I know that you believe that you can die tomorrow so you spend as much as you can today but would you be willing to save a bit and use some of your resources now to create a better day tomorrow?

You don't have to start awesome to get what you want, but you have to be willing to start now to be awesome.
