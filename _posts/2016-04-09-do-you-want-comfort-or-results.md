I didn't lose any weight since I started crossfit last year. I lost 3 inches from my belly. Medium sized shirts fit me now when previously large sized shirts didn't. My legs now have muscle and it previously compares to girl legs.

I can still get better. I'm training to develop the body that I want.

I got to talk to a buddy at the gym who is successful at losing a lot of weight. He makes his own food so I thought his advice is better for my situation. I don't want to resort to buying my food from a delivery service. Unlike a lot of people I enjoy cooking. So I started a conversation and I began to follow his advice.

His advice was simple. 
1. Chicken and fish. Or beef and lean cuts of pork. Lots of vegetables.
2. Don't overeat rice or bread. 
3. Make seasoning simple, salt, pepper and olive oil. You can use lemon and vinegar and chilli but more than that makes it too complicated.

I asked him later about brining. He asked me what it was for? Being a chef I knew he knew what it was for. I said for taste. Then he told me that I'm complicating my meal plan again and I should just stick to salt,&nbsp; pepper and olive oil.

He then said something that changed my perspective. I suddenly got what he meant. 
He asked me.. When you make your food is your goal to lose weight?&nbsp; Or is your goal just to be happy with what you eat and just maintain your current weight.

He's right. I've been doing well maintaining my weight. Haven't made a lot of progress in the last couple of months losing more fat.

I need to pick up my game. I'm better than this. And I could tell he chose those words because he knew I can do it.

Many activities that bring results are not comfortable. Many activities that are comfortable do not bring results. In my case the results are little. It's time for me to experiment the opposite.

I'll let you know how it goes. If you have questions just send me a message.&nbsp;
