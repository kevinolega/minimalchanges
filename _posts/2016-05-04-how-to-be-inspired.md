Make friends with people you look up to.&nbsp;

Watch stories that move you to take action.&nbsp;

Learn from people who have done it.&nbsp;

Observe people who failed and consider doing the opposite.&nbsp;

Do something small that moves you forward.&nbsp;

Life happens here and now and not in your imagination.&nbsp;

Instead of overthinking try something small.&nbsp;

One prayer.&nbsp;

One question.&nbsp;

One step of an activity.&nbsp;

One small move is all it takes.&nbsp;

Then you're &nbsp;moving.&nbsp;

Then you take another step.&nbsp;

Then you're at you goal.&nbsp;

Then you achieve your goal.&nbsp;

Then you move on to what's next.&nbsp;

That's how it often goes.&nbsp;

Just like the last several things you achieved.&nbsp;

I was born naked without the ability to speak and no knowledge of the world.&nbsp;

Then I'm here and now with everything I have.&nbsp;

This is not the end of my journey.&nbsp;

I'll face challenges.&nbsp;

I'll win some.&nbsp;

I'll lose badly to a lot of it.&nbsp;

I'll learn.&nbsp;

I'll grow.&nbsp;

I'll die.&nbsp;

But it will be fun.&nbsp;

Because I choose the do something worthwhile.&nbsp;

My journey inspire others.&nbsp;

Just as the journey of others had inspired mine.&nbsp;

Starting today I'll convert my good intentions into action.

I'll use my body to answer prayers and bless others.&nbsp;

Just as God uses other people to answer mine.&nbsp;

Kevin, the stranger from the Internet is praying for my success he als answers questions so I can get a job.&nbsp;

I got this. I won't let the effort go to waste.&nbsp;

I'll start by recognizing my blessings and the resources and effort that my parents and the people around me had put in and I'll make the most of it.&nbsp;

I'll stop reading now and take action.
