Bet on yourself.&nbsp;

Root for yourself.&nbsp;

If you don't nobody else will.&nbsp;

It's okay to be afraid.&nbsp;

Fear is a sign that you should head in that direction.&nbsp;

Fear is where the magic happens.&nbsp;

Instead of wondering what people you admire would do, another way to approach life is by doing it yourself.&nbsp;

If you make a mistake, you can make adjustments or you can try again smarter.&nbsp;

The world is unfair because many of it is set up in your favor.&nbsp;

The thing is in our hesitation we tend to believe otherwise.&nbsp;

One small step then inch it forward.&nbsp;

One workout. One prayer. One question is all it takes to get started.&nbsp;

Life happens here and now and not your imagination.&nbsp;

Try it out and see where it tak s you.&nbsp;
