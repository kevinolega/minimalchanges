Original Title: Bypass Self Doubt With Small Steps

Bet on yourself.

Root for yourself.

If you don't nobody else will.

It's okay to be afraid.

Fear is a sign that you should head in the direction you are going.

Fear is where the magic happens.

Instead of wondering what people you admire would do, another way to approach life is by doing it yourself.

If you make a mistake, you can make adjustments or you can try again smarter.

The world is unfair because many of it is set up in your favor.

The thing is in our hesitation we tend to believe otherwise.

One small step then inch it forward.

One workout. One prayer. One question is all it takes to get started.

Life happens here and now and not your imagination.

Try it out and see where it takes you.
