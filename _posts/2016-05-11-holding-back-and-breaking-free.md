Sometimes the source of my depression is the lack of results.&nbsp; Every now and then people ask me, why I'm not successful yet. I look at my life and see how far away I am from my target. If I appreciate how far I've changed I feel happy about it but sometimes I notice that I'm too damn slow. Not that I'm blaming myself. I tell myself this because I realize that I can do better.

I have goals but I'm not achieving success. I'm not failing. I find myself not behaving the same way as who I am. So I ask myself. **What am I doing with my time? ** I see the truth. I'm not executing the work.&nbsp; I'm not doing the tasks.&nbsp; I'm too distracted. This is post is about what I'm changing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1. Clean up my life.**
What's a mess?&nbsp; Clean it up. Remove the things that don't benefit me. Smoking.&nbsp; Bad food.&nbsp; No sleep. Messy room. After cleaning up you'll get the clarity you need to focus. Clean up enough that you get yourself started then clean up some more with each break. 
**2. Use simple tools**. 
I already have all the tech that I need. I just need to simplify.&nbsp; I don't need to buy anything new. Since I'm a writer I just need to write and submit&nbsp; my work everyday.
**3. Use a guide**.
Not software.&nbsp; Just a paper.&nbsp; What do I need to do? I have it in front of me. Make sure your guide only has everything important that you need to do.&nbsp; This guide will be your map on what you need to do next. Just follow it to the letter.
**4. Follow the guide**.
Every day I write down every task I did.&nbsp; I have an accomplishment report. I write down each task as I progress.&nbsp; It reminds me that I'm working.&nbsp; If I don't do this,&nbsp; I watch anime and YouTube videos all day.&nbsp;

Its difficult to get things done. There are too many distractions. Other than knowing what you need to do and doing it,&nbsp; the only obstacle is myself. I need to be patient with myself and get myself working consistently.&nbsp; If not then progress will not happen.&nbsp;
