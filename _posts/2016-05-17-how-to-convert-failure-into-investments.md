Here's a quick lesson.

Create a failure log. On a page on your notebook write down every mistake and every failure you had. Write down every negative thing about you. This sounds crazy but just do it. Give yourself ten minutes and write down as much as you can.

Here's a list if you're still having a hard time. 
- Write down every failure. 
- Write down every mistake. 
- Write down every bad thing about you. 
- Write down ever bad thing people said about you. 
- Write down every regret. 
Write down anything you are ashamed of.

See if you can reach 100. See if you can reach more. Just write as much as you can.

Now consider this:
Each failure is a story. 
Each failure is a lesson. 
Each failure is an investment. 
Each failure is a teacher that will guide you as you work toward your success.

Now some questions. 
What can I learn from each one?
What can I improve about myself? 
How has this made me a better person?
How have I been wiser as a result of my failure?

People learn better from failure. As long as your failure doesn't kill you you can use it to your advantage.

Now give yourself thirty minutes and repeat the process. List down as many failures as you can. Once you're done write down as many lessons as you can.

Now you have mastered your failure you can use it to your advantage.
