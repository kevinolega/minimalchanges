The flat surfaces in your home reflect the state of your mind.
 
If you have everything clear then it is easy to focus. 

If it is cluttered it is difficult to focus.

Take a photo of each place. 

1. Your bed. 
2. Your desk. 
3. Your dining table. 
4. Your sink.

What does it look like? 

Does it look like something you'd like to post on social media? 

If not how can you fix it that you'd be proud of it. 

Clear it up.

As a result you can clear your mind. 

Your brain unconsciously counts the clutter. 

This makes you use will power to get basic tasks done. 

Get to empty. 

When your space is clear getting tasks done is effortless.
