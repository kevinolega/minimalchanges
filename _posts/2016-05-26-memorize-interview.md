The purpose of an interview is to sell your self. Not to answer interview questions like a quiz or a beauty pageant.

Instead of memorizing answers to interview questions you need to know who you are and your advantages.

Most people are dumb about who they are. Since I broke up with my girlfriend from five years ago I've dated different girls and the level of stupidity and the lack of self awareness that I encounter is just crazy.

<ul>
    <li>Many people doesn't know how to tell me about themselves.</li>
    <li>Many people can't tell stories.</li>
    <li>Many people can't ask questions.</li>
    <li>Many people can't even decide what they want to fucking eat.</li>
</ul>

Here's the thing. Be self aware. Ask yourself questions.

Who are you?

Where are you from?

What are you interested in?

Why do you you want to work in a call center?

How old are you?

At this age why did you pick call center jobs as your preferred work?

What are the skills that you're good at?

What are your accomplishments?

What are your good characteristics?

Can you tell me ten stories about challenges that you faced and how you overcame them?

What are your weaknesses?

What are you doing or what did you do to overcome a past weakness?

How do you handle a difficult job?

How can you convince me to hire you?

Don't be stupid about yourself. If you fail interviews maybe it's not the answers. Maybe the interviewer thinks you don't know why you're there or you don't know who your are.

Ask yourself these questions. Write down your answers. Are you happy with your answers? Think of a better answer. Always ask yourself, "How can I say it better?"
