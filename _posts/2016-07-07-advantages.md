People tell me every week "I want to be like you." I'll tell you what, here's how to do it.

I didn't finish college but I find it easy to spot and take advantage of opportunities. Because I don't have the money to send myself back to school, I began collecting advantages that I can use.
<strong>1. Smart friends</strong>. I have smart people who have advantages over most of my friends. I envy them but instead of stopping there, I made it a point that we became friends so I can learn from them. Smart friends have brought me to opportunities other people don't have access to. Make smart friends. Take care of them.
<strong>2. Books</strong>. Books are the cheapest way to gain an advantage. In the Philippines books are expensive. 300, 500, 1000 pesos or more but books enable you to make more money or save money. A book on money management may cost me Php 2,000 but makes me Php 60,000 a year in savings every year. Buying books enable you to multiply your money.
<strong>3. An email address</strong>. An email address is the best way to contact people. Create one on gmail and email people and stay in touch. It's better than social medial.
<strong>4. A blog</strong>. A blog enables you to teach what you learned. If you learned one thing a week and post it on your blog you have fifty two lessons that year. That's a lot of wisdom you can share with people you admire. Do it for a few years and you'll be an expert at what you're trying to learn.
<strong>5. Notes</strong>. Memory isn't the most reliable way to store information. Write it down. Get a nice notebook and write everyday. Write your questions, write your blessings, write your problems.
<strong>6. A personal review</strong>. Who are you? What's your story? What are you trying to do? What are the steps that you're taking? What works? What doesn't work? What bad habits do you quit? What good habits should you start?
<strong>7. Mentors</strong>. These are highly skilled people. I usually get mentors by doing people favors. I treat them to coffee and ask them questions. Many of my mentors come in the form of books. Some of them are people on the internet. I share their work on facebook. I buy their products and I start a conversation. Mentors are often busy. Get their attention by paying for their work.
<strong>8. Technology</strong>. I invested in an iPhone and and Android Phone and a Laptop. I read books, listen to podcast, download courses, YouTube guides. My tech is my mobile school. It doesn't give me a certificate, but it gives me know how. Filipinos are retarded with technology. A lot of my college friends are too. Don't be retarded with technology.
<strong>9. Jobs</strong>. Each job helps me gain confidence. A CEO or Manager trusted me enough to pay me to do work. At the same time I learn skills that are useful for many different businesses. Take care of your job and the skills that you learn will take care of you.
<strong>10. Mythologies</strong>. I read the Bible, watch anime and movies. I like stories that will encourage me to move forward, even if it doesn't look good at the beginning. I'd rather find a way than just give up. Myths, are simplified ways of explaining things. It's a story of a struggle and how to overcome it with faith and action. Our lives mirror these stories and it makes things enjoyable.
We may never meet but I'm happy I get to contribute to you through my writing.

Thank you for your attention.
