I usually try to improve so I can prepare for a job that has higher pay. I've done this successfully since 2001. I used these lessons to learn martial arts, to get hired in a call center, to learn how to sell, to become top agent, to learn how to make websites, to be a popular blogger, to get a raise, to start my business, to get fit, to learn to cook and so on. You'll take these lessons and succeed in anything that you're trying to learn.</span></span></div>

A partner keeps you accountable and tells you what's wrong. A partner challenges you to be better. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-xbDPFnhog">Watch this video</a>. </span></span></div>

<div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="ftd1e-0-0"><strong><span data-offset-key="ftd1e-0-0"><span data-text="true">7. Buy a book. </span></span></strong><span data-offset-key="ftd1e-0-0"><span data-text="true">A book is the cheapest way to get an education. A book often takes a year or more to write and was written by a really smart person and edited by his or her friends. Buying a book is often like buying a skill and borrowing the brain of an expert. Books are also shortcuts to multiplying money. You pay Php 500 to Php 2,000 for a book and you get something worth more in return. Here are some examples based on my experience: </span></span></div>
<div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="ftd1e-0-0"><span data-offset-key="ftd1e-0-0"><span data-text="true">Some books taught me how to get jobs(20k a month, 45k a month and work from anywhere). </span></span></div>

<div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="ftd1e-0-0"><span data-offset-key="ftd1e-0-0"><span data-text="true">Some books taught me skills so I don't have to spend on some things (how to cook 6k a month, how to draw 5k a month, how to take care of websites 10k a month.</span></span></div>
