At my level. It takes me 16 interviews before I can find a company who has an opening that matches my skills and at the same time will have an offer that matches what I want.
Often, after several rejections we feel down and think that there’s something wrong with us.

If you’re the kind of person who tries to learn and improve that’s usually not the case. If you’re reading this blog I’m sure that isn’t.

Companies want someone who’s skills, personality and attitudes match their requirements. You also have the same privilege. Say no to companies you feel doesn’t match yours. If it’s not a good match learn to say no or if you don’t like the offer or the terms and conditions of employment look for someone else.

If you want to work in a specific company or industry, ask them what you needed to improve on after a “we’ll just call you response.” It show’s that you’re really interested and at the same time should they choose not to hire you, you’re improvements will be an asset to their competitor.

If a company won’t pay for the value you can deliver somebody else will. Never settle.
When I share this attitude in person, people cringe at the thought of walking away from opportunities. I can guess that’s because they believe that opportunities are scarce. In my experience there’s more than enough opportunities for everybody. The problem is that we give up when we hit roadblocks.

When I look for work, after I finalize my resume, I print twenty copies. That way I know that I have no right to complain until after I use up each one in an interview.

Hesitation will rob you of more opportunities than walking away from bad opportunities ever will. I also want to bring your attention to the fact that if you pick a job that you don’t like simply because it’s a job offer and you haven’t gotten one, you’re closing the door to other opportunities as well.

Company recruiters assume that you want to work for a company when you go to an interview. Have an attitude that you’d like to see if you want to work here. It puts more odds in your favor. If it doesn’t work out walk away.

Who would want a husband that beats his wife and asks her to pay for all the expenses? Pick carefully and understand that no job like no guy or girl is worth stressing yourself over.

<strong>Anyways here's a summary:</strong>
First five applications suck. I usually say something stupid or I just fail the interview. So it's okay. That's just practice.
Next five applications are bad companies: So I pass but this time they don't pass. The pay is too low. The work conditions are bad. The boss wants suicide bombers not employees or something like that.I walk away from these job offers.
The final five are acceptable. They like me and I seem to like them. At this point I pick the best. You don't want to just pick the first good offer, you need to compare so you have a good deal. Don't compare it with too many though. Five is good.
The final one, company number sixteen is where I'll work.

<strong>Always remember:</strong>
Apply, make an offer, get a deal or walk away. Repeat about sixteen times.

Send me a message if you have questions. I'm praying for your success. Kevin
