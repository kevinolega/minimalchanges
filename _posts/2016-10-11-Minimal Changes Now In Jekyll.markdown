Minimal Changes started as a Wordpress blog but after several malware infections entering my server from some themes that I tested and forgot to delete, I decided it's time to take my blog to the next level.

Jekyll is a simple tool.

You can use it to write your files in Markdown and it will generate a static website for you.

Here's why Jekyll is more attractive to me compared to Wordpress:
1. **Jekyll has no database**. That means a lighter footprint so Jekyll is expected to load faster.
2. **Jekyll doesn't require a login**. I can only access it though my webserver.
3. **My main writing tool is now Atom**. It's a text editor originally for programming but since it's not primarily a writing tool, it doesn't have the bells and whistles other writing tools I've used has and I'm not as distracted.
4. **Jekyll accepts Markdown**. Most of the tools I used allow me to write in Markdown. I'll just email myself the blog post and I'll publish it on my computer when I get home.
5. **Jekyll is free**. After all the trouble I've had, I'm actually willing to pay to get out of using Wordpress. Fortunately I ran into Jekyll through a fellow blogger and someone I greatly respect [Ev Bogue](http://evbogue.com).

There's probably more things I can do with Jekyll that I haven't explored. After all, I'm new to using Jekyll.

This is more like an unboxing post and I'm extremely excited to see what Jekyll can do. Stick

If you like Jekyll or you want to talk about it, feel free to send me a message.

Thank you for reading.
