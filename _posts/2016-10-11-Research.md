People from India stay up all night to learn things just for the prestige it gives them.

They use commutes and all idle time to better themselves.

Companies are always looking to hiring reliable people.

Call center companies always have job openings because people leave for higher pay.

Good call center companies are always hiring.

Research is a useful skill. You can Google anything. Here are some useful questions that will give you an advantage over other applicants.

1. What are the top 100 most used words in the English Language? Can you pronounce each word correctly?
2. What are 10-15 call center companies near your area that you'd like to apply in?
3. If you will commute from your house to the call center area, and will apply for two weeks, how much will you spend on fare and food?


See if you can find the answer yourself. Let me know when you've found them.
