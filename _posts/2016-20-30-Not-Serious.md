>"A Jedi requires the deepest commitment and the most serious mind." - Yoda

That is complete horse shit. I lived my life based on the above movie quote.

I applied this philosophy to my religion, my work, my family and my relationships and realized I've been wrong my whole life.

Authority figures seem to want you to believe this because you turn over what control you have over yourself to them.

You can be the hero who sacrifices himself to let them get away and boy did they get away with it for a long time.

Until one day you realize that a belief that you never consider questioning is the reason why you need to pull so much weight in your life.

Because of it's miss-use (i.e. serious relationship, serious about my goals, take work very seriously, take you seriously), we mistake seriousness for sincerity. I did, at least, for as long as I can recall.

Seriousness is not sincerity.

Seriousness is paying undue importance to something, at the cost of everything else.

Sincerity is a focus that has enthusiasm and giving your best without excessively worrying about the outcome.

So be sincere instead of serious.

Seriousness does not provide you with better output. Whenever I find myself comparing the results of my playful effort and maximum effort I found out that whatever boost I get from grunting and suffering is only about 4-10%. [Derek Sivers wrote about a similar experience while cycling](https://sivers.org/relax).

I previously lost a lot of sleep over small problems when the solution often requires sleeping over it or giving it more time.

There's a lot of applications from work to martial arts but what you need to remember is to never take it seriously.

Be sincere, be playful and alive if your goal is to accomplish.

Seriousness allows you to mimic the dead, unmoving and unyielding.

Practice kindness on yourself and only apply a gentle focus, just enough to direct you to where you want to go.

So take the time to regularly check with yourself if you are serious or sincere and whether you're applying a playful effort of maximum effort.
