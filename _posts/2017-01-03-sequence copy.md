#### One Line To Describe Month

Learning to outsource.

I've been getting a lot of new client work. 

After years of patietly learning the craft I finally broke through with my freelancing work. Sure I'm happy but I'm working sixteen hour days. I'm learning to eliminate, automate and outsource some of my 

Busy isn't a badge of honor.

#### Here's what's new with me. 

- New clients 
- Part time work at a CrossFit box.
- New blackout curtains to improve sleep quality.

### Recent wins: 

- New friends.
- Learned how to change the Jekyll theme and add website components to my Jekyll blogs.
- 1 Rep Max Deadlift PR of 280lbs from 265lbs.

### Books I'm reading: 

1. How to Think Clearly. This book talks about the [list of cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) that I recommended everyone read to study how the mind works and how some companies take advantage of our thought process. Each cognitive bias is discussed in easily digestible bites.


### What I'm Watching:

No time to watch anything unfortunately. I saw Logan though. Which deserves [this post credits scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIl_FiV8V6E). 

#### Five useful lessons on the internet: 

1. [The perfect system doesn't exist](https://zenhabits.net/system/).
2. [Marathoner vs Sprinter Lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrDqWbBMA9o).
3. [Hot to beat your to do list](http://thefyslife.com/article/precrastinating-avoiding-the-to-do-list-trap/).
4. [How to make shrimp fried rice](https://www.evernote.com/l/AI75S6kofN5E_Kr8atJOmGlxTMczUQF3vTM).
5. [What wrong means](http://exilelifestyle.com/wrong-means/).

#### Bible verse I'm meditating on: 

> "And the King will say, 'I tell you the truth, when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were doing it to me!' 
> - Matthew 25:40
 
The church I go to has a lot of cool lessons about how to live well as a Christian and over the years I have accumulated notes full of lessons, a significant hard drive space of podcasts and books however I realized that I spend too much time in church and discussions with frinds in a bible study sessions but very little time applying this to real life
