More rules I now follow:

Write on your old iPhone. 

Use that item you're reserving for special occasions. 

Use what you have on hand. You don't need to buy as much as you think. 

Send messages to your future self. 

Instead of reading new tricks read your own.

Stop reading the Bible. Study your own Bible study notes. 

You are more capable than you think. You don't need a guide as much as you think that you do.
