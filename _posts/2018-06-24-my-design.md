> "This is my design." - Will Graham 

Everything that is happening is my choosing.

Whether it is conscious or unconscious.

Everything that happens to me is my responsibility.

What I do and what I don't do has some influcence over the outcome.

That being said, I have the opportunity to sit back and admire my work.

Alternatively, I can also get off my ass and do something to change today.

This is my design.

Everything I am in the present and everything I recall from my past is my making.
