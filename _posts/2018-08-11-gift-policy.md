Thank you for considering giving me a gift.

I'm really grateful I have someone like you in my life.

At the moment, I have already purchased everything I've ever wanted.

All my clothing needs are met.

All my tech needs have been met. 

I have a kitchen that can match Jaime Oliver and Gordon Ramsay. I'll probably get a Microwave and Electric oven but I'm in no rush to get one.

I own three amazing bikes.

I have a fully furnished home office.

I'm actually trying to reduce my possessions by [selling most of what I own.][1]

If you must insist, here are some ideas.

My charity work, involves writing [job hunting tips for aspiring BPO workers][2] and you can help[promote us on Facebook][3].

### Help fund my work

Producing these articles and maintaining this website costs money. 

To help out, you can send us money through the following links.

- [Support me on Paypal][4].
- [Support me on Patreon][5].

### Get these freebies:

If you get these freebies, we both get a benefit.

- **[Create a Dropbox account and we both get free 500mb online storage][6]**. This is perfect for saving your resume, having a private backup of your photos and files that you can access from any computer. 
- **[Create an Uber account so we both get free rides][7]**. Uber is better than taking a taxi. Install both Uber and Grab and you never need to buy a car in the city. Uber no longer operates in the Philippines but I hope to use it when I travel out of the country. So if you are in a country with active Uber operations and you haven't signed up, please do so [from this link][8].
- **[Create a Grab account and we both get a Php 40 discount][9]**. Grab is an alternate to Uber and beats taking a taxi. Install both Uber and Grab and you never need to buy a car in the city. [Use the code: GRABKEVINOLEGA][10]
- **[Buy from my Online Store][11]**. I'm trying to get to minimal by selling some stuff I'm no longer using. If you find something you like, send me a message.
