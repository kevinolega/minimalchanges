The present is all there is.

The past is a concept from a combination of memory and imagination that is often not factual because your emotional state and the stories that you tell yourself distorts the representation.

The future is a concept from a combination of fantasies from my daydreaming, my aspirations, guesses based on what happened in the past and like the past is not factual.

Nobody can predict the future perfectly. 

Even Jesus admits that he doesn't know all the details about the future.

The best we can do about the future is guessing.

Aside from the fact that you and I and everybody that we both know is going to die somewhere in the next year to a maximum of ninety years there is nothing that we can predict for sure about the future.

The present is all there is.

Here an now.

Today is INSERT DATE.

The time is INSERT TIME.

I am here at INSERT LOCATION.

I am INSERT YOUR INTENTION AND ACTION.

This is what you should focus on.

The rest are distractions.

Let's both focus on the present.
