Nothing is permanent.

Look at all the good in your life.

The people that you love the most will either suddenly or eventually disappear.

The items that you most value will be suddenly or eventually be taken from you.

The windows of opportunity will suddenly or eventually end.

Your life will also suddenly or eventually end.

Now look at the things in your life that you consider bad.

Your biggest troubles will eventually become something you laugh about.

My favorite writer Colin said in an old blog post that ''Today's tragedies are tomorrow's comedies." and I find this to be true.

Time will heal the pain of loss.

Death will likely end any pain you'll experience.

So whatever it is that you are now anxious about, or worried about, you can just let it go.

You can stay in the present.

Worry is silly.

That's because everything is temporary.
