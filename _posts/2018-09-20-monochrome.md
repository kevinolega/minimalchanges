I am way more productive when my devices are set to monochrome. 

On a black and white screen, I appear to be more efficient and objective.

I don't have a long explanation but apps like Facebook and whatever else don't call out to me as it did on a colored screen.

I also feel less distracted.

When I'm doing work that's not color sensitive, I turn the color off from my screen.

Whenever you find yourself distracted, turn off the color and get back to work.
