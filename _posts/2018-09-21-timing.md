> "For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn’t go out of its way to line up the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. “Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it “eventually,” just do it and correct course along the way." - Tim Ferriss

There's not much to say to expound on this idea.

Aside from some obvious consequences that would be a result of bad timing if you do it today,  I say "go for it!"

Do it later if the timing is bad, but do it.

Don't tell anybody, don't get things validated. 

Your opinion is the only important thing here.

Is it important?

Will it improve your life?
