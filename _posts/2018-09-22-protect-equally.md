Protect your time, attention and energy as you would your money.

We often fight tooth and nail to prevent people from taking our money.

What I often realize is I give so much of my attention and eventually time, energy and finally money to other people and often in that order.

Getting someone's attention is the key to taking their time, energy and money. 

That's the reason why great work is done in solitude. 

Block distractions, and distance yourself from people who profit from your attention.
