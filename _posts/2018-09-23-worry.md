Worry is silly. 

There is so little that you can control in this life.

Accepting what happens is a smarter strategy.

If you believe in God, "He is in control of everything and His will is perfect."

If you don't believe in God, the universe is so vast that anything that you do is insignificant.

You are much better off doing your best to manage today well.
