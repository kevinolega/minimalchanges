Kindness feels good.

We are upset when we do not receive kindness.

I think it is unfair that we are kind to others and unkind to ourselves.

I also think it's unfair that we only expect to receive kindness from others.

The most qualified person to give yourself kindness is you.

Instead of being your own worst enemy, be your own best friend.

Be kind to yourself, and you will be able to unleash your full power.
