Failure teaches you lessons on how to succeed.

However, success is built on top of success.

When you fail, you simply don't have what it takes to win at that event.

That being said, you'll need the skills, confidence and strategies that can be gained with small victories.

If your goal is too big, you'll need to break it down to small targets.

Small goals allow you no excuse to fail.

Failing is draining and victories are refreshing.

If you are failing, you just need to build up on smaller targets.

Over time, your gains will build up over time and with enough attempts, you'll be able to breakthrough several weaknesses.
