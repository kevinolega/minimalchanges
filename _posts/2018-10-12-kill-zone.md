Create a killzone before you initiate.

Before you engage in anything, create a killzone.

What is a killzone?

A killzone is a position where any opposition has no chance of resistance agaist you.

It's a state where you are extremely effective.

How do I get in a state where I'm extremely effective?

Here are some samples.

I have gotten enough sleep.

I have meditated.

I have joined three to four workouts that week. 

I have a good workspace with little to no clutter.

I prayed about my situation.

I have trapped my worries on paper.

I ate healthy.

I've experienced cold exposure. 

Usually, a combination of these have made me very effective.
