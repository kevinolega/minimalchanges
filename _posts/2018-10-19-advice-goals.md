I don't remember who gave this advice to me but whoever you are, thank you.

> Big goals sometimes distract you. Have small ones that you can achieve on a regular basis that have a small impact. These can grow over time. 

Based on experience, everything small I did, grew in no time.

>Don't get caught up with tail chasing because it gets you nowhere. 

There's a lot of advice that makes people go tail chasing.
