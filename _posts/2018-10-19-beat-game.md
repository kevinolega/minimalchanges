Here are additional questions to consider. Many of these are follow up questions. Here goes.

What game am I playing?

What output determines my score? (Win/Lose)

What skills do I need to be great at?

What moves compose the skill?

What are the steps that I need to master?

If this were easy, how would this look like?

What is the minimum effective dose for me to win?
