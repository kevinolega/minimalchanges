Flow is intense concentration. 

Learn to hack flow. And add it to my routine. 

Flow follows focus
High consequences 
Dopamine
Rich environments 

Find opportunities outside of work to use flow. 

Between boredom and anxiety.

Reinvestigate fun activities you shelved. 

You see possibilities you couldn't see before. 

4% higher than previously. 

Challenge skills ratio. 

Stretch not snap. 

High performers reach higher than 4% but will achieve less because of an overflow in stress hormones. Go slower. 

Low achievers will break at four percent. 

Dont hit publish until you're uncomfortable at what people will think of you.
