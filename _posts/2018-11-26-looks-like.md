This is perfect.

This what it is.

If you're considering concepts like God's will or the process of growth and improvement, this is what it looks like.

Very few things are amazing instantly.

The process is a slow, boring climb to an unremarkable field.

Notice how almost every inconvenience that you complain about is a byproduct of a blessing that you previously prayed for.

Yes.

No use forcing things.

Trust the process.

Trust yourself.

Have fun along the way.

It doesn't have to be otherwise or something else.
