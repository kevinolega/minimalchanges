Biking tools



I do my best to travel light whenever I can.

Recently I've been traveling to and from quezon city and I have a family member at the hospital so I'm often out overnight and have to work while I'm out.

I pack in a way that meets my current needs.

Using a paper notebook and pad and a regular pen to draft my writing and plans for the day and communication is an incredible way to save battery on your devices.

As slim pad and a small notebook goes a long way.

Stick to only two pens.

The biggest battery drain is caused by staring at the bright screen and trying to think of what to do next. This escalates by opening your favorite social media network and scrolling endlessly through the newsfeed. 

I have small labled packs that I carry with me whenever I have a specific task:

Overnight
Day Two
Charging
Bike Repair
Etc.

I try to pare down my pack and take the tier down version of my tools before I leave.
