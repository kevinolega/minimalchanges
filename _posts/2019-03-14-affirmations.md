I put the explanation at the [bottom](### Notes). 

### SPIRITUAL 

None of it is serious.

God is in control. 

God is on my side. 

Life is 90% blessing 10% learning.

God created me in His image and likeness. 

God granted me with all the powers of heaven. 

When I allow God to reign, none of the powers of hell can defeat me. 

Continue to do good. 

You are awesome. Demi-god-like.

Worry is silly. 

Be thankful and grateful for everything that you have. 

It is by grace.

All is temporary. 

Everything will be destroyed. 

Everything in nature has the characteristics of smoke. 

Don't rush. 

Have a cheerful and playful attitude. 

Don't become too hard on yourself or highly critical unless your job requires you to do so and even if you have to do, limit it to the specific task.

### TODAY

Focus on the day. 

Do today well and the long term will sort itself out. 
When you do what you're supposed to do, the future sorts everything out.

Never be absent minded. 

Pay attention to here and now.

Always be intentional about what you are trying to do. 

The action is here.

### OBSTACLES

Obstacles are sometimes referred to as problems. 

Unless you are a professional (you can accomplish the task whether you feel like it or not) problem solver it is more beneficial to refer to these as challenges or games.

Difficult problems are simply a combination of several easy problems arranged in a sequience that can be confusing at first glance.

No matter how big or intimidating a problem is, you can disect it and break it down to small manageable and actionable tasks using only a pen and paper.

Whenever things are hopeless, that simply means you haven't found a solution to the problem you are working on yet.

Play with your problems and you'll always find a solution.

Constraints enable you to do what you need to do. 

There are several things that you have no control over.

There are more things to do in the mean time. 

Focus on what you can do. 

Whenever you don't feel like working recall that scene in Star Wars Episode 2: The Clone Wars where Obi-Wan Kenobi screams at Anakin Skywalker while on the Clone Trooper Transport "We have a job to do."

Accepting what you can not do enables you to do what you can do well. -Itachi Uchiha

Negative emotions are signals to take action.

Change the meaning, your communication or strategy.

Be mindful of the metaphors that you use.

Read this in Darth Sidious/Emperor Palpatine's voice. 

"Do what must be done, do not hesitate, show no mercy"

### Notes

For as long as I remember, I put together this list of lessons and affirmations on a page in my notes app and pinned to the top. 

I try to read this everyday or whenever I can. It's a list of statements that represent a combination of beliefs and views that I'm trying to include in my personal beliefs.

I believe that what you believe determines how you behave.

Here goes.
