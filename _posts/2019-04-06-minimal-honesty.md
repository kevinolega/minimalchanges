My minimalist journey has after almost ten years, led me to the pursuit of being honest.

A common reason why we want to buy things that we don't need is because we can't sit and experience certain emotions. 

For example, when we buy or bring with us excessive extras or duplicates of just in case items, we are worrying about our fear of needing something later.

When we buy things to please others, we are tapping into our fear of rejection or fear of being a social outcast.

When we say yes to attend an event or gathering, we are agreeing even if we don't want to because we are afraid that other people will be displeased with us.

Food is also an area this applies to. We eat an excessive amount because our ancient human brain is thinking about eating as much as it can because of its fear that doesn't know when it's next meal is going to be available. Modern humans have access to food almost anywhere at any time of the day.

Instead of tapping into our courage, creative thinking, and our ability to solve problems, we opt for the shortcut of buying things and agreeing to something we don't really need and want in our life.

And it's an ongoing practice. Everytime you buy something on impulse or say yes to an event that you don't really want to go to it's developing your muscle or instinct of saying yes even if you don't want to.

As a result you pay with money, time and attention for these things and have reduced your ability to apply these resources to the actual areas that you want to apply them to.

The more sinister effect of this is you have developed the practice dishonesty by compliance.

You end up being dishonest about what you want and this often escalates into a vicious cycle.

The more stuff you buy the more silent lies you put out into the world. Instead of admitting, I'm broke or I'm not available or I don't really want to go, we lie some more by saying yes by buying more, agreeing to something we don't agree with.

When all this is done, you are being completely cruel to yourself in order to please someone else.

A greater consequence of this is that the lines between right and wrong are blurred with what's offensive or what's socially acceptable.

And if we were to always go with what's socially acceptable, I think that you and I both know and agree that this does not match the practice of applying minimalism to your life.

Honesty is.
