Whever I say I have a problem or describe a situation as a problem, I end up feeling dread or tense.

The word problem is associated with all sorts of negative feelings and often conjure up nightmare images.

Truth is, problems are often just tasks.

Often, problems are just tasks without defined instructions and maybe some missing details that I'll have to fill in.

Sometimes these tasks can be complex and may require some thought or need to be solved on paper. 

I recall a talk by Jim Rohn. He said Jesus was a miracle worker and that whenever someone came to him with a problem, his response was 
"No problem!"

I've made several problems disappear by giving it some thought and paper. But that's for another story.
