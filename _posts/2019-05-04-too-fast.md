As far as technical details go a vehicle's maximum speed is one of the most exciting number to learn about.

Speed is valuable to some extent.

A high speed sprint timed well can win races.

Speed is valuable, however, when you become too focused on trying to increase your speed you eventually hit a point of diminishing returns.

If you give it more thought, you'll realize that the maximum speed is something everybody already upgraded including you. 

It is equally important to know the minimum manageable speed because that's what sustains you in longer challenges.

This is an opportunity where you can focus on on moving forward and going past obstacles and minimizing errors.
