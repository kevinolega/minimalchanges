There is value to getting to a milestone first.

If you are competing in a race, going after a girl, trying to get a job or a business deal, being first has many advantages.

However, in the pursuit of speed, we tend to sacrifice other valuable advantages.

We've all heard of the saying "haste makes waste" and "most of your progress can be canceled out by a simple error"


The obstacles that block you block others too.

I learned from bike racing that the obstacles that stop you also stop other people. 

Let me say that again. The obstacles that block you block others too.

The traffic light, the pot holes, the unexpected obstacle, the uphill climb that makes it difficult for you to move forward. 

Forget about going fast. 

Seek to become unstoppable.
