I started writing again.

I started writing big again.

I utilized my paper and my nice pens again and the ideas are again flowing freely.

I am getting more of the important things done.

I am shining the spotilight on just one idea.

This gets me excited to write again.

The previous version was on a fourth or a quarter of a sheet of paper and I realized I'm missing a couple of lines that I need to fill in as I encode on my text editor.

As I write on the bigger piece of paper, I feel more confident with what I am writing.

I feel unstoppable.

I keep writing.

I now use the full page.
