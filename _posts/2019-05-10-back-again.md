When learning new habits, it's not uncommon to lose enthusiasm, get distracted or completely stop.

It doesn't matter how beneficial the practice is.

Whether it's a physical, mental, spiritual, financial, business or other discipline, you might encounter this obstacle sooner or later.

I experienced this in my daily reading, journalling, blogging, exercise, prayer, meditation, spiritual practice, and other important areas of my life including work deliverables and personal care.

It is easy to get distracted and fall off.

Just get back again.

If you are doing something beneficial and you know that the practice will change your life for the better, just get back again.

We are all distracted.

We all fall short.

We all make mistakes.

We all act on stupid decisions.

Just get back again.

Beating yourself up is unnecessary and counter productive.

Just get back again.
