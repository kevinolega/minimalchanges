Moving forward, I now refrain from praying for an outcome. I pray for these instead:

- Focus
- Patience
- Calm
- Mindfulness
- Creativity
- Energy
- Discipline
- Cooperation
- Wisdom
- Frugality
- Contentment
- Protection
- Perception
- Awareness
- Acceptance
- Gratitude
- Mastery

Some thoughts about prayer.

Based on experience, praying for an outcome produces the most anxiety.

It's also tempting to judge if God favors us or not based on whether we consider the outcome is favorable or not.

Humans are horrible judges of God's will, what's good for us long term and short term.

Whatever God allows it's all good for us, long term, whether we agree or not.

Praying for a stat boost allows us to enjoy life and get a little help.
