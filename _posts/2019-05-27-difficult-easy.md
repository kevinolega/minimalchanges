Difficult problems are made up of a few easy tasks combined.

Consider this complex math problem:

(5 + 2) x (3 x 5) * (2 + 4) - 5

It will probably be challenging to think of an answer in your head.

It might also require more than just keying in numbers on a calculator.

There's a math problem solving rule that says you multiply first, then divide, add then subtract.

Can you add five and two?

Can you multiply three and five?

Cn you add two and four?

Can you multiply the first result by the second result?

Can you multiply the answer by the third result?

Can you subtract five from the final answer?

Difficult problems are just made out of a few easy problems.

Write it on paper and solve it little by little.s
