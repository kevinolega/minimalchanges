Impossible is twenty five to a hundred easy problems.

In the previous lesson, we established that difficult simply means a combination of a few tasks.

If a difficult prolem is composed of five easy problems. 

And one impossible task is five difficult problems.

Consider this.

An impossible problem can mean a project that has anywhere between 25-100 easy tasks.

So whenever you're facing an impossible problem.

Remember that you only need to complete 25-100 easy and usually boring tasks.
