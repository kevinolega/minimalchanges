A master's job is to trick you, swindle you and fool you until you can no longer be tricked, swindled and fooled.

Always remember that.

This applies to mentors, guru, coaches and instructors.

That's why they give outrageous advice and charge ridiculous prices.

Because the goal is your independence, you have to learn that early.
