A master's job is to trick you, swindle you and fool you until you can no longer be tricked, swindled and fooled.

Always remember that.

This applies to mentors, guru, coaches and instructors.

That's why they give outrageous advice and charge ridiculous prices.

If the goal is independence, learn this early..

Masters are simply tricksters. 

Tap into your inner wisdom.

The best person to make decisions for your life is you.

Do your own research.

Make your own decisions.

Decide if the benefits are worth the costs to you.

And own up to the consequence.

You are 100% responsible for your life.

Not somebody else.
