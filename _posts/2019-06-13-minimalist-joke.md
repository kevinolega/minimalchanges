Here's a corny, mean and probably tasteless minimalist joke. 

Why does it cost a fortune to stay in a fancy hotel for a night? What do they have that you don't? Whats the difference between a fancy hotel room at the Shangri-la and your bedroom? 

You probably have aircon, TV, internet, access to a fridge with good food. 

What makes people willing to blow $200-400 a night in one of these rooms?

Answer?

Well. It isn't drowning in clutter like your home that's for sure. 

Peace.
