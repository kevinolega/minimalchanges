I have so many tools and tasks have begun to pile up.

I currently have over 19,000 email.

I have 9,000 notes on my Evernote app.

I have over 30,000 unsorted photos.

I have a text folder with a hundred files.

I use several project management software.

I have powerful note taking apps installed.

My Google Drive has hundreds of files on my account.

So does my hard drive.

I want to.

Scale down to a text file or a notebook.

Or as little as possible.

I'm moving my journaling to my text file or blog.

Less complex.

More manageable.
