Social Media is a Powerful Tool.

If you own a business, it's the best way to spread your ideas.

Unfortunately, if you're on the receiving end, it might not be helping you as much as you think.

If you already have a plan for your life, many of the benefits you get from social media come at a cost.

Every good idea you pick up from this river of endless information...

• adds items to your tasks.
• distracts you from your current work.
• sometimes discourages you from doing something you should do.
• drains you and leaves you unable to execute today's responsibilities.

Just as video games are good training tools, spending too much time is harmful.

Unfortunately, different people have different opinions on how much time you need to spend on social media.

Often, the distraction is more harmful than NOT getting these fresh ideas.

I found myself arguing with vegans on social media.

I'm madly typing at my keyboard to argue about minimalism, the environment, healthy diets and a whole bunch of other topics.

I've wasted so much time.

I've turned off Notifications on my phone for most apps, except for my Calendar, Client Communication and Text Messages.

But I still check all my feeds and spend a minimum of three hours a day.

I spend most of July 20, 2019 just rotating between, Facebook, a couple of blogs I read, Instagram and YouTube.

In the past, I deleted my Facebook account.

And reopened a year later.

I've grown an audience to approximately 20k.

I've connected with clients and people who helped promote me.

Unfortunately, social media is slowly taking up my time.

In the past I struggled to:

• Keep my room clean.
• Keep my office clean.
• Keep my computer clean.
• Keep my phone clean.
• Meditate.
• Go to the gym everyday.
• Buy groceries and cook my own food.
• Write for my website.
• Work on client projects.
• Work on my personal projects.
• Go to church.
• Read books that contain knowledge.
• Learn new skills.
• Ride my bike.
• and many more...

But I have religiously checked my Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other messengers daily.

Before Apple rolled out the App Usage Tracker, I already knew how much time I spent reading people's posts, watching stories and looking at cute photos.

That's why I deleted my Facebook account the first time.

One benefit of Facebook is you can reach people.

At the cost of them reading all your conversations and using that to target you with advertisement.

But you can reach everyone.

So somehow that's something we consider to be an acceptable trade off.

## Here are New Facebook Rules

### My Websites Are My Social Media

My thoughts and opinions go to my websites.

[Announcements go to my homepage](https://kevinolega.com/now)

[Career advice gets documented here](https://callcentertrainingtips.com).

[Personal development notes go here](https://callcentertrainingtips.com).

[Records of my adventures and recommendations go here](https://callcentertrainingtips.com).

[Workflow goes here](https://businessideasph.com).

I'll only use Facebook to message people.

I'll stop participating in the following features.

• Stories
• News Feed (because I can read this forever)
• Groups (because I'll lose my discipline type all day in the comments section)

I don't recommend this for anyone else.

This is for Kevin Olega.

As a form of voluntarily facing my weakness.
