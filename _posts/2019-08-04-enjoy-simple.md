This is cliché. 

Others may refer to this as cheesy, corny or unrealistic.

Of course there’s opposition to it.

Contentment is an unpleasant word to employers and salespeople who seek to benefit are your expense.

Holding a loved one’s hand. 

Laughing and conversations. 

Enjoying a meal.

Push-ups, Squats and Burpees.

Reading a book or a blog.

Writing your thoughts.

These are free. 

Sure you may need a pen and paper or maybe a computer but these can be acquired with little to no trouble unless you want the latest and usually most expensive model.
