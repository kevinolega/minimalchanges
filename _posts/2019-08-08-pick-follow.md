I'm not talking about just saying Jesus is Lord and Savior.

We are talking about the taking action part.

I learned this lessons from Jordan Peterson.

Paraphrased for levity.

Jesus said, 

> "pick up your cross and follow me."

Pick up can mean:

- own up to
- take full responsibility 
- take full ownership
- accept like accepting a gift or job

Cross represents: 

- a heavy burden
- an unfair burden
- the heaviest burden you can carry

Follow me:

- take action
- use adversity to transform your life
- overcome your lower brain's thinking

And that's the whole point of that section of that conversation. Discussed in modern language.
