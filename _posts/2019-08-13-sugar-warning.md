First off...

Let me say this.

I'm grateful for your generosity.

I really am.

It's just that I'm really struggling to communicate this, and I have failed to do so multiple times. 

So I'm showing you this short note instead.

A few months ago, I discovered that I have really high neuroticism.

Like top 97% high.

That being said, I discovered that to avoid this issue and prevent it from affecting my performance at work, my income and day to day functions, I'm avoiding all forms of...

- Sugar and sweets
- Carbohydrates (rice, bread, noodles)
- Junk Food and chips.
- Alcohol
- Sleep deprivation

And every time I avoid this, I'm able to stay functional.

I am able to perform well and I am able to keep my life in order.

But every time I violate this, I just feel horrible.

I'm unable to focus.

I feel depressed.

My thoughts become incredibly pessimistic.

And I lose my self-discipline.

My status goes down and I'm unable to work and I sometimes lose anywhere from $200 to $800 because of poor work performance. 

It's actually taking everything I have in me to resist this.

And I appreciate and respect you.

And I'm showing you this note because I really hope that you understand.

And I'm begging your support.

So I'd like to take a pass on this.

Because I don't want to resort to losing my cool and upsetting everyone.

And I don't want to just walk out on all of you.
