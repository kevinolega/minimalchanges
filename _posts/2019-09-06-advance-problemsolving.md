Some advance problem solving strategies have entered my mind.

We all have success formulas.

We have a list of skills.

We have topics that we're knowledgeable about either as a fan, a practicioner, an expert, a student or a worker (or former worker) in that field.

That experience has some insight and very specific and powerful success formulas.

Here's a strategy to draw that all out.

You might need paper and a voice recorder (just your smart phone)...

And quickly just ask yourself the following questions.

NOTE: These are based on my skills, experience and methodologies that I'm familiar with. You can make a list on your own by writing everything you know on a piece of paper and using that page to build your list just like I did.
