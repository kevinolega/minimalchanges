My exploration of Christianity taught me the following lessons:

**1. Use a journal because good advice is incredibly easy to forget**. 

Write it all down.

**2. The lessons from the Bible are ancient wisdom**. 

Most of it is good advice. 

Some stuff don't make sense but let's focus on the good advice first. 

Read daily. 

And make your life better.

**3. Good advice is only useful when applied to day to day life**. 

There are wealthy Christians and poor Christians. 

I observed many wealthy Christians and many of them do their best to apply what they learned and never stop studying.

I've also observed wealthy people claiming to be Christians but never following the advice.

**4. Jesus said, pick up your cross and follow me**. 

That means, take ownership of your heaviest burden. 

That means confront your fears. 

That means do the right thing even if you don't feel like it. 

Maybe the reason why you're not able to build the life that you want is you're always running away from responsibility? 

That's usually the case.

**5. The Bible has a lot of weird stuff**. 

So I've ignored the weird stuff for now, but I still ask questions that help me understand. 

I explore, I research and if it still doesn't make sense, I put it in my journal and come back to it later.

**6. The Bible is a complex topic**. 

First off it's 66 books. 

So you won't be able to finish it in one sitting. 

And that's okay. 

You can do one chapter every day. 

And maybe finish in a year. 

I went to weekly Bible study because it's good to discuss with people.

**7. Everything I learned here applies to different topics**. 

Journalling, focusing on good advice, applying good advice to daily life, taking responsibility, asking questions so I understand, continuous learning and improvement and asking others has helped me pick up the skills that I needed to build the life that I want. 

I'm sure there's more wisdom but I'll stop here for now.


UPDATE 2023:

God is the representation of the highest standard of the highest good. 

Jesus of the personification of the perfect man, the spirit of self-sacrifice for the benefit of others and a bright future, forgiveness, victory, and the traits embodied in his stories.

The devil is the spirit that tricks desparate mortals into sacrificing the opportunity to play "all future games" in exchange for an easy and probably shallow immediate win.

Christians probably shouldn't separate God and the Devil.

Despite the "Devil's" monstrous depiction, the image of the devil isn't something you should fear becoming. It's the form you should transform into when the situation calls for it.

There's a popular Christian image of the lion and the lamb. I misunderstood Christianity as just being the lamb.

A Christian is someone who possess both the brutality of the lion and the gentleness of the lamb.

Eastern philosophy mentions "demon hand with Buddha heart" which translates as a skilled warrior's hand and a saint's heart.
