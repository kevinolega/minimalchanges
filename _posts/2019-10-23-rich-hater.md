There’s so much hate for the rich.

Almost everywhere I go, different organizations have some form of smack talk for rich people.

Church people keep quoting Matthew 19:24. It goes like this. “Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."

Vegans hate the rich because they eat beef, lamb, veal and lobster so to them the rich are murderers who fund and promote the rape, torture and exploitation of animals.

Environmentalists hate the rich because many of them own big companies and some of them own private planes or fly frequently on commercial airlines so to them rich people are destroying the planet on an unprecedented scale.

Minimalist groups are a mixed bag because many of them are practicing minimalism to get their time and finances in order but I have encountered some negative comments myself.

I posted on a local minimalist group that “Clutter is the status symbol of the poor” and that I used the statement “smoking is a poor man’s activity” to get myself to finally quit smoking. 

It worked by the way, in case you’re wondering. 

I’ve finally quit smoking. 

Something I previously struggled with and thought to be impossible.

While I’m jumping up and down for joy, celebrating and sharing the good news...

A couple of readers angrily responded “what’s wrong with being poor?”

Then as if on cue, the vegans and environmentalists jumped in to quote me on my controversial post of how I think the carnivore diet is the ultimate minimalist diet. 

I’ve been called an elitist on multiple occasions.

I’ve met some Filipinos who defend poverty like it’s a virtue.

Wealth is a complex target but it is also just a number.

And if my grade in school is  70%, then that is a poor number and I require more effort to increase my score.

My question for you is, would you wish poverty on your loved ones and kids?

Don’t you want to get rich?

Don’t you want to improve your status?

Don’t you want the ability to get what you want done?

Don’t you want the ability to afford good thins and the ability to pay people a good return from the product of their work?

I recall reading somewhere that you won’t be able to hold something you hate in your hands and even if you do, it won’t be for very long.
