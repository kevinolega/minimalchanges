I was watching Batman Begins earlier.

This quote caught my attention.

This is attributed to Christopher Nolan but it was delivered by Liam Neeson portrayed by Ra's Al Ghoul during Bruce Wayne's training arc in the League of Shaddows.

> “But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangling the grief, until the memory of your loved ones is just poison in your veins. And one day you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed, so you'd be spared your pain.”

― Christopher Nolan

There's a reason why I explored minimalism and letting go.

The more attached you are to things, the more it is difficult to let go.

It's probably a never ending struggle, I already let go of most of my stuff, twice and as I lived my life, I find myself participating in activities that built up the number of items in my home.

So now I have to pare down again.

There's probably no state of minimal, just a never ending process of paring down as you live your life.

In the same way, there's a lot of application of this principle in other areas.

There's staying healthy.

There's building strength.

There's accumulating resources.

There's maintaining relationships.

And so on.

Getting to minimal allows you to do a little bit more than you would compared to when you're overwhelmed but not by that much.

However, one would argue that this small difference accounts for a lot over a long period of time if you can manage to stay consistent.

I recently got a fitness tracker and it's helping me prioritize my health and sleep.

Now I'm paying more attention to working out, eating healthy and getting enough sleep.

But I'm currently worried about my management of my other resources and commitments.

And I'm juggling again.

As I write this post, I realized that I do not have any answer to share.

I'm just documenting the process.

And sharing my thoughts as I go along.

I'll probably have more insight later.
