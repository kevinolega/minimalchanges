I've been going on and off on my workouts.

I've been looking for ways to make the process of exercising daily easier for me.

I've copied WOD's from my CrossFit coaches and that doesn't work.

Sometimes I feel great.

Sometimes it's too hard.

Sometimes a CrossFit workout requires too much motivation.

So I have a difficult time copying CrossFit WOD's verbatim.

But I'd like to do some for fun.

I like doing Karen, Fran and 18.0 workouts for fun.

I was looking for a way to keep the workouts easier so I tried to do AMRAP (As Many Rounds as Possible within a specified time period) orEMOM (Every Minute on the minute)for one movement for 5 minutes.

It all sounds like a good idea but whenever I'm about to start, I cringe at the thought of doing lots of burpees compressed in a five or ten minute period.

I was able to do a 5x5 weightlifting protocol without any problems.

I'm pretty sure that my attitude is the problem.

So I'm poking around different methods that can get me moving regularly again because I don't have access to a gym at the moment.

I've been looking at my problems with competing.

I tend to sprint.

I go all out and run out of gas.

I have the same problem when I was a regular at a CrossFit gym.

I go all out for a couple of days and as a consequence I'm too exhausted and miss working out for a week or two.

When I was a beginner, I can only do a limited amount of reps so I am able to do go to the gym, workout and come back tomorrow.

Now that I've developed my strength and my skills, I tend to go 100%, burn out and disappear for more sessions than I'd like.

I was heroic instead of consistent.

I'm trying to fix that.

So I decided to scale down to Tabata workouts.

Tabata workouts consists of eight rounds.

Each round is twenty seconds.

At the end of each round, you will rest for ten seconds.

Whenver I did well in a long workout like Karen, I'd give 70-80% effort and rest for ten seconds.

So I figure this practice helps me put in the reps without feeling intimidated.

I know my weakness.

Sometimes I have the mental toughness to power through challenging CrossFit WOD's.

But I'm not like that every day.

I feel horrible for missing workouts and that turns into weeks of no workouts.

So I have a new strategy.

I do a Tabata workout for each movement.

I start with jump ropes then I add movements.

I do about six to eight movements.

I do a couple of rounds of shadow boxing if I feel like doing more work.

Here's my Tabata workout.

## Workout Numbers

Here are the number of reps that I try to maintain per round.

These numbers go higher or lower depending on how I feel that day.

If I feel weak, I put in the lowest number I can maintain. 

Two to five reps is still 40 reps per movement.

If I feel I wanted to workout some more, I just repeat another round and maintain the same or lower number of reps.

**Air Squats**: I try to maintain 7 reps. I do five or six if I feel weaker.

**Scap Pulls**: I try to maintain 7 reps. I do five if I feel weaker.

**Pull Ups**: I try to maintain 1 rep. I do two reps if I feel stronger.

**Push Ups**: I try to maintain 7 reps. I do five or six reps if I feel weaker.

**Burpees**: I try to maintain 4 reps. I do two reps if I feel weaker.

**Hanging Knee Raise**: I try to maintain 6 reps . I do five reps if I feel weaker.
