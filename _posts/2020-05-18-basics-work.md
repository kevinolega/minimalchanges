When I was younger, I was always looking for advanced techniques and tactics.

I like complicated and flashy moves.

I was trying to emulate moves that I saw in Kung Fu movies.

It didn't occur to me until I am older that this preference also influenced other areas of my life.

Many of these moves are high risk, high reward techniques.

These moves look cool and I always fantasized about delivering these moves myself someday.

As I grew older, I discovered that true masters specialized in basic moves.

No matter what the martial art or the discipline, the best in the world are the people who have mastered the first six basic moves really well.

They can deliver two of the most basic moves at an almost unbelievable level perfection.

What’s mind-blowing for me is that many of the experts that I followed in the disciplines of culinary, writing, drawing, cycling, entrepreneurship, sales, marketing, martial arts as well as other world class athletes and performers have this in common.

Instead of trying to be an advance practitioner, consider learning two most basic moves and focus on winning using just that.

Learning basic moves are often boring and that’s one reason why less than one of one thousand practitioners ever become masters of their craft.

Hone the two basic moves to perfection.

The basics always work.
