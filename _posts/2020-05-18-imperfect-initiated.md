Perfectionism means not starting.

I want it to be perfect, which means I’m not going to start it.

The truth is, nothing will ever be perfect.

No decision is perfect.

There are always trade offs.

But we always have the opportunity to come back and make things better.

Don’t let the information stay with you.

Implement your idea and release your idea to the world then make improvements as you receive feedback.

I previously told myself that I need to overcome inaction due to perfectionism.

I’m initiating that change by publishing this imperfect post.
