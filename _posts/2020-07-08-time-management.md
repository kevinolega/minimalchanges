There are two kinds of wants.

1. What you want now.

2. What you want most.

You can only choose one.

What I want now includes, watching YouTube, playing games on my computer, and watching Netflix.

What I want most is to build a life where I am earning my target income, and I am fully capable of supporting my family while doing what I enjoy.

To achieve this, I need to continue following my schedule religiously studying, writing, exercising, working, eating healthy, and sleeping on time.

When I was younger, I thought I could balance both.

When I got older, I realized that you need to sacrifice one or the other.

If I go after what I want now, I sacrifice what I want most.

If I sacrifice what I want now, I succeed at getting what I want most.

I can't tell you what you should do.

Decide what you want yo sacrifice.

What's more important to you?

What you want now or what you want most?
