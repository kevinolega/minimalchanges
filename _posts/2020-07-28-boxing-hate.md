When I learned boxing, I had a lot of fun with the punching drills.

I love punching the bag.

I love practicing with the coach.

I love sparring.

My coach tells me I should spend time doing the following:

1. Jump rope.
2. Running.
3. Conditioning and ab workouts.

I hated all three activities.

I lose my breath with jump ropes, running, and I hate ab workouts.

So I skip all these activities whenever possible.

I have a good defense anyway.

My coach throws a very light punch in my gut during sparring.

I felt like I'm going to die.

He tells me I can punch really hard.

But it only takes one shot to put me down.

I hate running, jump ropes, and ab workouts.

I practice those more often now.
