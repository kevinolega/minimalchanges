What are your six non-negotiable foundational movements?

Kelly Starrett asked this question on his website, The Ready State.

It got me thinking.

Deadlift because it gives me a strong back and a strong core.

Squats because I need the leg strength to lift heavy objects.

Burpees because I enjoy suffering.

Thrusters because I enjoy suffering.

Pullups because I associate pullups with strength, and I'm weak with pullups.

I'm just putting this list here.

He did say that these movements should be considered when you plan your accessory work around your workouts.
