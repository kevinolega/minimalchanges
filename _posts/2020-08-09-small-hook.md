For the longest time, my punches only consisted of jabs and straights.

I don't have any hooks and I don't have any uppercuts.

That changed when I took some boxing lessons.

I learned how to throw a hook and I learned how to throw an uppercut.

Since I'm not a professional boxer, my instructor is a little lax with my hooks and uppercuts.

We work the mits until I'm exhausted.

We sometimes end with him holding the mits up and me doing uppercuts or jab straight non-stop.

I noticed that I developed a bad habit.

The hooks that I throw feel more like haymakers with large movements.

I know that large movements are slower, telegraphed and easily countered.

On my own, I need to practice smaller movements with my hooks.
