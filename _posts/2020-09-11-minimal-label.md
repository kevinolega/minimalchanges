Back in high school, I used to be a big science fiction and video game nerd.

I was also fascinated with the occult.

I thought that the label atheist gave people the impression that I'm intelligent.

I didn't realize it's just part of a rebellious teenage phase.

When I got to college, I became a rock music and martial arts geek.

I started working early and explored different sales jobs.

I held business cards that said Property Consultant, Financial Planner, as my job title.

I became an officer-in-charge at a small training center.

Whenever I needed more cash, I did part-time work teaching English.

My friends in entrepreneurship circles gave me opportunities to sell high-end wares.

I became the product expert of whatever I was selling at the time.

I became active at church.

I adapted minimalism mostly to help organize my belongings.

The entrepreneurship groups' sales events encouraged us to slave away for bigger houses, cars, and vacations.

The big goal-setting sessions began to conflict with my desire to simplify.

I would also prefer to skip working weekends.

I stopped accepting new customers.

I stopped selling when my stock ran out, and I quietly left.

I had an attractive job offer in corporate sales, and I sold to big companies.

In 2009, I started writing as a hobby and posted my ideas online.

I also began to meditate on the importance of time.

My life required a reset, so I took a mini-retirement.

To simplify my life, I quietly took a tech support job at a BPO.

I became active at CrossFit.

I delved into culinary training.

I sold food at work for extra cash.

I purchased a bicycle.

I used the money that I saved to buy a good computer, an iPhone, and faster internet.

I took a part-time job managing a small fitness center.

I began working from home.

My first job was as a writer.

I also worked as a virtual assistant.

I became a project manager for a tech company.

I adopted a dog.

I printed a business card that just had my name, my website (also just my name), email, and phone number.

People began asking what I did.

I had a difficult time answering the question.

So how does Kevin introduce himself?

The question was easiest to answer back when I was selling something.

I'm Kevin, and I sell insert whatever.

My background and cycle of learning made it easy for me to pick up and shed titles.

Every now and then, I found myself hoarding titles I've held in the past.

Fancy titles were useful when you're looking for work.

I'm no longer looking for work.

Financial Planning, Entrepreneurship, Sales, and Marketing Consultant are no longer my job titles.

These titles are instead titles of folders in my computer that contains notes that I enjoy reviewing from time to time.

I don't say former atheist turned Christian, who's into minimalism, tech, cycling, cooking, and entrepreneurship for social events.

That would be too long.

I don't even say martial arts practitioner because the younger me challenges people with martial arts training to sparring sessions.

At the time of this writing, I have a simple, boring job.

Our business sells simple, boring products and services.

I still enjoy writing, and occasionally accept writing jobs.

I still enjoy exercising, so I rotate cycling, weightlifting, and martial arts.

I decided that all the titles and labels that I held are no longer me.

All my past titles are just folders under the category of past work and interests.

When I introduce myself, I'm just Kevin.

Instead, I just let people talk about their titles.

I'll focus on listening.

I'd like to be a better listener.

Maybe that will be my title.

But I'll keep quiet about that too.
