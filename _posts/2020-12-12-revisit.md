Don’t keep an eye out for the new. 

Open your eyes on how responsible you were with the old. 

Don’t look for new tools. 

Did you get full use of your old tools?

Don’t look for new lessons. 

Did you integrate the lessons that you learned in the past? 

Don’t make new resolutions. 

What resolutions didn’t you complete?

Don’t seek blessings. 

What blessing have you been taking for granted?

Don’t seek new opportunities. 

Did you ever achieve mastery with what you have?

Don’t fantasize. 

Do utilize. 

We’re gifted with the ability to visualize a wonderful future. 

We sometimes forget that gifting attention to our present situation is equally awesome. 

Thank you for your attention. 

Have a blessed holiday season ahead.
