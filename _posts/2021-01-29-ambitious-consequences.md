What would a good coach do?

A good coach holds the athlete back during training.

The purpose is to unleash the athlete during competition.

I have a tendency to dive into my death metaphorically when I become ambitious.

I write or edit code until I'm exhausted when inspiration strikes me at 1am as I'm preparing to go to bed.

Doing so has royally fucked my entire rest of the week.

I need to hold myself back when this happens.

Some days, I stop eating, exercising, and even showering as I work on what I'm writing, work, code, or a video.

I need to get back to getting the mundane parts of my life in order.

If I take care of the mundane, the exciting will take care of itsself.

I lost my big fights by focusing on the exciting and neglecting the mundane.
