### Small things

The small things that you do every day build your future.

### Responsibility

Everything that happens to you is your responsibility.

### Smaller Circles

Make smaller circles. 

The big moves leave you open for counter attacks. 

Mastering the small straightforward moves are your best bet.

### Home and Work Balance

Your home responsibilities are part of your work responsibilities until they aren't.

If you work from home and you sacrifice food prep, tidying and exercising, cut down on workhours and get the maintenance tasks in order.


### Dream???

Talking about goals.
Talking bout how you're only happy for two weeks after you achieve your goals.

Something about joining Bible study with the other person not comfortable leading but will lead if they have to. - Possibly a dream.

### Motivation

Don't feel like studying or working

### Epic stories

Epic stories are stories about people confronting their problems.

### I'm a moron.

One mistake is going to cost you a lot of money.

I'm a moron.

If you watch enough of my videos, you'll realize that I'm a moron.

### 47 Hours

If you work, 13% more hours, you earn 80% more money.

That's about 47 hours a week.

That said, I'll need to spend 47 meaningful tasks weekly.
