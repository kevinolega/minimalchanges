Tim's work in the 4 Hour Work Week has been a key element in my pursuit of controlling when, where, and how I earn my money. 

The ideas that I learned from Tim's blog, books, and podcast had changed my life.

Jordan Peterson's work had complimented my implementation of the Josh Waitzkin lesson "making smaller circles" and as a result, I've had more success in my personal and work projects.

Jordan's work has helped me become more truthful and assertive instead of dancing around the problems with my higher level of agreeableness and neuroticism.

Both Tim and Jordan have shared countless nuggets of wisdom that improved my life.

Tim got me started honing my skills in writing and asking questions.

Jordan had given me more intricate tools and techniques to write, negotiate, and solve problems.

Here are the lessons that resonated with me from this episode:

Some insight from JBP's clinical practice:

Be patient and carefully observe how the other person is communicating.

Observe the pattern to discern where the conversation is going.

Paraphrasing here: JBP said something about holding your ground.

Intimately learn the opposite of what you're trying to understand.

High openness is dangerous for people who are high in neuroticism.

There are several domains of competence and projects available to pursue.

Carelessly destroying structure reintroduces the chaos that "the structure" previously protected us from.

The word religious may translate to the word deep. This is useful for discussions with religious and non-religious people.

The thousand-year-old game of telephone that occurred getting the story from our ancestors to modern-day has stripped non-essential elements from the story.

The story of Cain and Abel is a story about what happens when you respond to negative events with resentment.

Parallels in religions occur because we have identical problems as human beings.

12 Rules for Life: An antidote for chaos is about malevolence.

Beyond order: is the opposite. The book confronts "too much order?" I'll understand more when I read the book.

People think that life gets easier when you get from point A to point B. However, when you achieve point B, you are more anxious. You'll need another point B when you reach point B.

I really wish that this episode had a longer discussion.

I'll listen to this episode again and clean up my notes tomorrow.
