I saw a quote about how success requires countless of late nights burning the candle on both ends.

Anybody who's pushing you to work late nights is:

1. Not qualified to give you advice.
2. Not knowledgeable.
3. Not aware that poor sleep destroys your cognitive ability.
4. Knows #3 fully well and is using your lack of sleep as an opportunity to manipulate you.

You're more likely going to eat garbage when you don't have enough sleep.

Your body is likely running on emergency power and your brain is running on low capacity.

I made all my horrible decisions while I lack sleep.

My most painful losses happened in a state when I'm disoriented by sleep deprivation.
