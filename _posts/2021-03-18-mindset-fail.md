A good mindset is one important ingredient a person's arsenal.

Mindset is important.

You also need technical skills and specialized knowledge.

You'll also need a combination of resourcefulness and actual resources.

You may need a mentor.

A legit mentor will also say that you need money, skills, good ideas, a proper plan, and customers.

People selling "mindset" as the end-all be-all are like people saying that you can open a food business by owning a single potato.
