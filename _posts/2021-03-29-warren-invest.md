If you got doubts...forget it.

That's the advice.

The goal of investing is to make money.

You are investing in people if you are investing in companies.

As an investor, you hope that the people running the company will treat their business with the same enthusiasm and care as before you gave them the money.

If you're dealing with characters that have questionable ethics, please do not invest.

If you got doubts about the investment...forget it.

Paraphrased.
