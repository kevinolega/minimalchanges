I ocasionally Google repetitive phrases that I hear in anime.

This is one of those phrases that I hear often.

I'm just saving the translation here.

kimi wa hitorijanai

you are -  not alone

hitori-de = alone

I've seen antata wa and kimi wa translate to "you are."

This is a nice line to understand.
