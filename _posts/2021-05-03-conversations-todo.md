Do you ever feel that you have something that's good to say but the timing is all wrong.

I wash the dishes and clean the house when I'm having difficulty sleeping at night.

I listen to a podcast or do my chores in silence.

I then suddenly get an idea of what I'd like to say.

Hi Mom! I forgot to tell you. We're going to the wholesale grocery next week. Do you want us to get anything for you?

Hi boss! I found this website that matches what you were looking for in our past conversation.

Hi friend. I'm selling this product and I remember you mentioned that you're interested. What's your email? I'll forward the info.

Hi friend! I just remembered this place that serve great shawarma. We should go there on our next hangout.

These are all good ideas.

Except, I'm having these ideas at 2am or 3am.

It's cool if your phone has a scheduling function.

Sometimes the conversation happens on social media or email or phonecalls.

I used to put my conversation ideas in my journal or notes app and the conversation gets forgotten because I write a lot.

Here's a small hack that I discovered.

Use your Reminders app.

I use Things for iOS.

You can also use IOS reminders for iPhone.

You can use Google Tasks for Android.

I created a separate list called conversations.

I put the name of the person on the title of the to-do item.

I write what I wanted to say in the body or notes section.

That's it.

I check my conversations during my down time.

I also spend a minute to think of what I want to say to people when I'm about to go to sleep.

I jot my messages in the conversations list.

Making an effort to remember consumes energy and keeps us awake.

Create a Conversations list in your to do list.

Write conversation topics so you have the topic nailed down.

Hit done when you're done.
