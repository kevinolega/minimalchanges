Are you struggling with minimalism or frugality?

Thoughts on minimalism.

We shop in our attempt to fill the empty hole in our hearts.

Our first thought is "buy," but what we sincerely desire is to "do."

I have a personal question for you.

What is the level of your mastery in the important areas of your life?

How skilled are you at your job and other important areas?

I have an even more personal question.

What is the level of your mastery in the small, mundane areas of your life?

How good are you at maintaining your living space?

How good are you at cooking?

How good are you at cleaning?

How good are you at organizing your space?

How skilled are you at physical fitness?

How skilled are you in armed and unarmed combat?

How skilled are you in these areas?

Do you know how to sell?

Do you know how to negotiate?

Do you know how to manage your money?

How skilled are you at recording your daily activities, expenses, learnings, blessings, and other life events?

Are you skilled at spiritual disciplines like prayer and meditation?

Are you skilled at reading and learning?

Are you doing something creative?

Are you doing something meaningful?

Are you doing something that will make your future better?

If you're struggling with impulse spending and you seem to lose all self-control to online shopping or thoughtless purchases at the mall, I'm writing this for you.

What pain are you trying to fill by buying?

Have you considered sincerely asking yourself the questions that I listed above?

Here's a confession.

I'm not at 100% in control of all my spending as well.

I was fortunate to record multiple situations my post-impulse buy thoughts in my journal.

In many cases, I hop on the upgrade treadmill because I'd like to feel more competent or powerful.

Buying a nicer bag or upgrading my computer makes me more efficient at what I do.

That said, I'd like to direct your attention to the questions I asked earlier about your skills.

If you'd like to feel a stronger sense of security, wouldn't it be better to practice shooting instead of buying extra guns?

If you'd like to be a master at the kitchen, wouldn't it be better to master a menu instead of buying another air fryer?

These are just my thoughts.

If you're struggling with impulse buys, direct your attention to your life skills.

Lack of life skills causes you to lose money.
