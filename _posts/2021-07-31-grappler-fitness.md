I'm feeling out of shape and realize that I have been skipping my daily exercises.

I'm interested in grappling and Jiujitsu in the past year and I'd like to get back into shape.

I'd like to be fit enough to join the program.

I've been doing research and assembled an exercise program.

I'll use this page to update the program and share my progress.

## EXERCISE PROGRAM

I'm following this exercise program for the next 30 days.

25 Burpees

25 Air Squats

That's it.

Just search YouTube for how to do burpees and air squats and you're good to go.

**I'M NOT VERY FIT**.

Me to. 

Here's my recommendatinon.

Invest ten minutes a day.

Aim to complete five burpees every minute.

Imagine one burpee every ten seconds.

Five times five is twenty five burpees.

You'll complete twenty five burpees in five minutes.

Repeat the same process for the air squats.

Aim to do five air squats every minute.

Do one air squat.

Count ten seconds.

Do another air squat.

You'll complete twenty five air squats in five minutes.

This is my goal. 

Here's my recommendatinon.
