Collect a spreadsheet of dead people in your contact database.

It's like having a private cemetery for treasured people who are long gone.

You can keep a list.

You can add details like birthdays and death anniversary.

Mine is just a simple list but I'm thinking of adding more info as time goes by.

I'll place some reminders to my calendar but this will contain the master list of people.
