I was asked about books on dealing with grief.

Here's my response.

Write your own book about your lost loved one. It doesn't have to be published.

Write about:

- Good Memories
- Bad Memories
- Lessons Learned
- Their wishes that you'd like to carry on.
- Activities you promised to do with them while they were alive but never got to do.

Transfer your thoughts in a computer or re-write in a nice notebook.

I often start with a few lines.

Those lines eventually turn into pages.

You don't really have to write a book but I wouldn't be surprised if your writing grows into a book.

Collect a spreadsheet of dead people in your contact database.

It's like having a private cemetery for treasured people who are long gone.
