Before you chase new skills, check which ones you’ve already mastered—and which ones you abandoned halfway.

Many people forget what they’re good at and ignore what they never finished.

This short skill check helps you list both.

### Skill Check: 2 Simple Questions

1. What skills have you practiced enough to confidently say you’ve mastered?
2. What skills did you start learning early but never fully developed because of distractions or life getting in the way?

For example:

### Category 1: Mastered or Near-Mastered Skills

These are examples of skills I have consistently trained, used, or depended on.

- Sales and cold market prospecting
- Writing blog articles and email marketing content.
- Training, teaching, and writing instructions.
- Strength training, CrossFit, and cycling
- Brazilian JiuJitsu (Kesa Gatame game) and kickboxing
- Cooking: steaks, pizza, and cheesecake

### Category 2: Learned But Not Mastered

These are examples of skills I studied and used for small projects but never took to a professional level. I can do some work, but there are still gaps in my knowledge.

- Arnis, Aikido, boxing
- Meditation.
- Mobility and Injury Prevention Work
- Website code: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Website backend and admin maintenance.
- SEO
- Content Marketing
- Video Page Marketing
- Graphics and Video Editing

### Next Steps:

1. Write the answers in your journal. Don’t worry about grammar, structure or explanation.
2. Add this to your calendar. Revisit every three months.
