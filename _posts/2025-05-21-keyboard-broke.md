I connected my Logitech Keys-To-Go to my old iPhone 6.

One page in, I noticed the letter **B**, the left shift, some symbols, and a left arrow key weren’t working.
 
Most keys work fine.

I’ve been thinking about it. 

My first reaction was to hop on the web and buy a new one.

Even AI says it’s better to replace it. Repair costs and the lack of keyboard repair shops in my location make buying a new one the smarter move.

Fine. I’ll buy a new one.

For now, I’ll keep using it.

I’ll tap the screen for broken keys.

The distraction-free setup still gets me in the groove.

It slows me down—but it helps me think.

And I realized—this isn’t just about the keyboard.

I’m often 90–99% ready for a task. But a few “broken keys” can throw me off. 

I panic. I rebuild systems. I restart entire projects.

That costs time and energy.

But sometimes, I get it done despite the gaps.

In other situations, I’ve done well with a few broken keys.

I rode over 100 km on a fixed-gear bike.

I won grappling matches with injuries and incomplete training.

I built an online presence using a USB stick, borrowed computers, and scratch paper.

Things don’t need to be perfect.

You move forward anyway.

Old tools. Broken tools. Still useful.

Action first. 

Guts fights a legion of demons even after losing an eye and arm. 

Ash Williams did the same against the deadites—with a chainsaw on his stump and a sawed-off shotgun.

Type your words. Hit record. Post your video. 

Write and send your proposals. Pitch new clients. Show up to meetings and interviews.

Put in the reps first. Collect the money first.

Then buy new gear.

Don't make the gear the reason you're not working. 


Tap “B” on the touchscreen if you have to.

You’ll be fine.
