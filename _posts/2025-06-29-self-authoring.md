Every time someone asks me, “What online course should I take to improve my career?” my answer isn’t a skills course. It’s *Self-Authoring*. Whether you’re in freelancing, tech, marketing, design, or any other field, this is the one program I recommend to everyone because it forces you to figure out where you’re actually going, why you're stuck, and what you're building toward. Before you learn a new tool or chase another gig, start with this.

I didn’t start *Self-Authoring* because I thought it would “unlock my potential” or any of that feel-good stuff. I started it because I was tired of going in circles.

I’ve made a lot of moves that looked productive as a freelancer. Applying to jobs. Taking on projects. Learning new tools.

The thing is, I was just following my intuition. My plan kept changing. I didn’t have a clear direction, just a vague idea that I wanted to earn money from the internet. I found income opportunities, but when I connected with other freelancers, I realized how stuck I really was.

Intuition and "going by feel" is a decent strategy during emergencies, but it's mentally exhausting and undependable long term.

I didn't realize this until it caught up with me.
A lot of the holes in my plan became clear the day my father died and my main client at the time refused to pay me for the work I billed in my last cut-off.

I had been taking on clients I should have said no to.
I had been burning months doing work that didn’t build toward anything.
I kept repeating the same mistakes from my past, just in new forms.
I got stuck earning 6 to 8 dollars an hour for way longer than I should have.

I constantly lost motivation. I kept blaming myself, thinking I was lazy.
The truth is, I was exhausted. Mostly because I hadn’t clearly mapped out my direction.

Looking back, I’m starting to believe I was depressed.

That’s what finally made me take *Self-Authoring* seriously. Writing about my past, present, and the future I actually wanted forced me to face the mess directly. It helped me stop relying on motivation. Instead, I started aligning my plans so I could move toward a state of no more excuses.

I’m not going to pretend it fixed everything overnight.
In fact, I bought the program in 2018 and only finished half of it.
But even that was enough to take me from 8 dollars an hour to 20 dollars an hour.
It’s one of the tasks that stayed on my to-do list the longest. It’s an activity I regret not finishing sooner.

Now, in 2025, I’m picking it back up to update my answers.
I’m shocked at how well I’ve dealt with some problems.
I’m even more shocked at how many solutions I already had in mind back then but didn’t follow through because I lacked a better plan or the confidence.

There’s a section where you list ideas on how to deal with major bad habits and recurring problems.
And I already wrote down what works.
But because I didn’t finish the program, I never built a detailed plan.
I didn’t solidify my response to those problems and habits.
I still don’t have a clear response procedure when they come up.

If I hadn’t checked again, I’d still be second-guessing myself.
If I had finished this earlier, I would have avoided a lot of wasted time, energy, and pain.

If you're freelancing and feel like you're just reacting, going with the flow, or working without any real direction, I strongly suggest giving this a real shot.

If you decide to purchase the program, feel free to reach out. I’d be happy to discuss it with you.

It costs 30 dollars, and there’s a limited buy 2-for-1 offer.
You can get one for yourself and one for your partner, or keep it for yourself and do it again in the future.
