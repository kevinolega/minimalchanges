Hello and welcome.

My name is Kevin Olega and I wrote collection of articles, stories and experiences I wrote on a bus to document my share personal growth which I describe as Minimal Changes.

To my friends, I'm a go-to guy for advice on problems and a wide range of topics that include: simplifying life, being efficient, finding work, saving money, picking a place to live, dating and relationships, personal protection, etc.

I write here to make my experience and skills freely available for you even if I'm not available to teach you personally.

<strong>The story so far</strong>

My past self is a consumerist workaholic zombie pack-rat who spent big money collecting a useless stuff, and went to work with at least five bags.

Nah this is from my travel to Malaysia but I looked pretty close to this a few years back.

I was obsessed about "getting results really fast" because I wanted to improve my situation and keep up with people I tagged as "successful". To start I read a lot of business books and "success coaches" and I found out that they insist that: I need a long term plan to get rich, then fast track to success. I don't buy that anymore. I got bored with a super fast-paced life and despite not being a guaranteed way to succeed, I decided to move at my pace just make things fun and simple.
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>My Minimal Change</strong>
start where I am,
use what I have
do what I can,
move forward.
do things slowly
make improvements to
be efficient little by little.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It turned out better for me than trying to rush my way into the fast track.</p>

After slowing down, taking a long hard look at my life, I dropped all my side projects, stopped accepting offers, <a href="http://minimalchanges.com/i-own-71-things-april-2011/">lived with less than 100 things</a>, changed directions and went for:

</div>
<ul>
	<li>a Location Independent Minimalist lifestyle - freedom by having less of the unimportant so I have more <a href="http://minimalchanges.com/blog/minimal-changes-to-achieving-what-matters-most/">room for what matters to me</a>.</li>
	<li>Financial Freedom - I got out of debt, spend less than I earn, have savings while I grow my income.</li>
	<li>Slow and permanent growth. - it's different when you grow at your own pace and not just chasing after unnecessary, urgent deadlines all the time.</li>
</ul>
