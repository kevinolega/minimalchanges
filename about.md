It is easy to lose perspective.

Motivation is fleeting.

Direction tends to go off track after a long enough time period.

There are lucid moments though whene we have access to wisdom.

Minimal Changes is a collection of lessons and epiphanies that I have docummented and implemented in my life and published on this site as a way to remind myself to keep my shit together in the face of difficult situations.

I'm Kevin and since 2008, I've been struggling with clutter, poor fitness, food choices, poverty, unhappiness, hopelessness, overwhelm, wastefulness, agreeableness and other weaknesses in my day yo day life.

I have implemented many strategies and tactics and built this site in order to create a quiet place for myself to think, ask questions and try to improve my situation on your own through writing and reading my own work.
