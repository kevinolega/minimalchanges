Hello and welcome. My name is Kevin Olega and I wrote collection of articles, stories and experiences I wrote on a bus to document my share personal growth which I describe as Minimal Changes. To my friends, I'm a go-to guy for advice on problems and a wide range of topics that include: simplifying life, being efficient, finding work, saving money, picking a place to live, dating and relationships, personal protection, etc. I write here to make my experience and skills freely available for you even if I'm not available to teach you personally. **The story so far** My past self is a consumerist workaholic zombie pack-rat who spent big money collecting a useless stuff, and went to work with at least five bags. ![Traveling Packrat](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/5053684332_03598716ae.jpg) Nah this is from my travel to Malaysia but I looked pretty close to this a few years back. I was obsessed about "getting results really fast" because I wanted to improve my situation and keep up with people I tagged as "successful". To start I read a lot of business books and "success coaches" and I found out that they insist that: I need a long term plan to get rich, then fast track to success. I don't buy that anymore. I got bored with a super fast-paced life and despite not being a guaranteed way to succeed, I decided to move at my pace just make things fun and simple.

> **My Minimal Change** start where I am, use what I have do what I can, move forward. do things slowly make improvements to be efficient little by little.

> It turned out better for me than trying to rush my way into the fast track.

<div>After slowing down, taking a long hard look at my life, I dropped all my side projects, stopped accepting offers, [lived with less than 100 things](http://minimalchanges.com/i-own-71-things-april-2011/), changed directions and went for:</div>

*   a Location Independent Minimalist lifestyle - freedom by having less of the unimportant so I have more [room for what matters to me](http://minimalchanges.com/blog/minimal-changes-to-achieving-what-matters-most/).
*   Financial Freedom - I got out of debt, spend less than I earn, have savings while I grow my income.
*   Slow and permanent growth. - it's different when you grow at your own pace and not just chasing after unnecessary, urgent deadlines all the time.
