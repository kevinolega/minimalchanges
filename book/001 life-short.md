I don’t have the time to write a long book.

I figured I can die tomorrow or any day and I haven’t put together my life wisdom in any meaningful way.

So here I am. Typing this on my iPhone.

Life is short.

When I hit 30, the number of funerals I attended increased dramatically.

Consider the possibility of your death.

And consider the possibility of a loved one's death.

Think on this, then give thanks for your and loved one's life.

Be more honest.

Hug people a little tighter.

Be a little more patient.

Understand that none of this is permanent.

Comparing life is not a journey or a battle isn't a very healthy analogy.

Life is a lot more like a song.

It has a track that has a beginning, middle and end.

So everything will eventually end.
