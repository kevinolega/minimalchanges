Minimalism is focus.

Focus on what’s important.

Unlimited is bullshit.

Unlimited allows other people take advantage of you.

You have limits. 

The money in your wallet have limits.

You only have 24 hours a day.

Each activity is costing you.

You only have 2,600 weekends if you’re lucky. 

A third of you will probably get less.

You probably used up half of your weekends before you’re aware of this.

You are now.

Say no to the unimportant.

Focus on what you value.
