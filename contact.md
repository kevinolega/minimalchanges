Thank you for visiting my website. Here are the best ways to contact me.

I love hearing from people, so please email me at [kevin@callcentertrainingtips.com](mailto:kevin@callcentertrainingtips.com) and introduce yourself.

### Why? Here are two reasons:

1. I love getting to know people around the world. (Many of my good friends online and in person are people who I met when they emailed to introduce themselves.)
2. Because I know a lot of people, I can help connect you with someone you should meet.

Yes it’s really me, and I reply to all.

### Read this first:

First please read my “[frequently asked questions](https://minimalchanges.com/faq)” page.

If that page didn’t answer your question, please search my site:

I don’t promote. I don’t invest. And [I’m not taking on any new projects](https://olega.org/no2). But I love to be aware of what you’re doing, even though I can’t get involved or answer questions about it.

So really the main reason to contact me is to **introduce yourself**, which I hope you do.
