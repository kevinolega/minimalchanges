Current Minimal Changes

**Journal** 

First thing in the morning and before sleeping as part of deloading.
This is really important. Having things written down enables me to focus and leave things alone.

I use a modified version of the bullet journal.

- I use a bullet to write down thoughts.
- I use a circle to record events.
- I use a square as a checkbox.
- Every now and then I just write a question and fill it in.
- I use two journals. One is for tasks and quick thoughts and the other one is for deep thoughts and my monthly planning. 
- Every now and then I ask myself the questions from the five minute journal.
- I also write down some workout notes or good things that happend today.
- I try to record important stuff to Day One.
I'm still trying to figure this out but these work well so far.

I do my best to start my day and end my day with the journal. Hopefully this will improve my writing. 

**Don't Push Past Exhaustion**

I have a fantasy of myself as a warrior that will fight even if I'm the last man standing. I try to emulate real and fictional characters who never give up.

Unfortunately this has been my downfall with my current tasks. I try to do everything on my own and exhaust myself.

This had been the major formula for my failure. In workouts I try to sprint to failure. I realize that I can do more when I'm well rested. I've succeeded at everything I took slowly. Every major win in my life is a result of embarrasingly small progress adding up over time.

My skills are a result of attempting to cook one batch of scrambled eggs a week.

Today I deadlifted 300lbs. When I started I can barely lift the 45lb barbell. The process is just me adding 5 to 10 lbs more at each attempt and eventually I got to 300. Pretty sweet huh.

### Experiments:
1. Fast once a week. Every thursday, skip breakfast and have your first meal at 4pm. Use tea to curb your apetite.
2. Do 5x5 for back squats, strict press and pull ups.


### Challenges:

1. I still find myself stuck scrolling through social media feeds.
2. I sometimes miss or skip writing on the journal.
3. I still try to do things alone when I should be delegating.
4. I'm still experiencing issues asking for what I need. This is probably a pride issue.
5. I recently found myself reverting to my depressed state. 
6. I fail to meditate, pray, practice gratitude, drink water, get enough sleep or do my breathing exercises.
7. I accumulated a shitload of digital and paper clutter.
